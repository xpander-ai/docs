## What is the Agent Graph System?

The Agent Graph System (AGS) lets you define hierarchical constraints for your AI agents, controlling which operations they can use and in what order.

<Tip>
While agents can see all available operations, they must follow the workflow you define. This balances autonomy with predictable behavior.
</Tip>

<Accordion title="When to use AGS">
- When your agent needs to follow a specific workflow with dependencies
- To prevent the agent from skipping important steps
- To enforce logical progression in data collection
- When building complex agents with multiple tools
- To guide the agent without overly restrictive instructions
</Accordion>

## Core Concepts

An agent graph consists of three simple components:

1. **Nodes** - Individual operations (tools) your agent can use
2. **Connections** - Define which operations must happen before others
3. **Hierarchical levels** - Group operations by their position in the workflow

## Example Agent Workflow that requires AGS

Let's explore a practical example of an agent that needs to follow a specific workflow:

Users might ask the agent to research a specific topic, and the agent should follow this sequence:
1. First, search for general information about the topic
2. Once basic information is found, extract specific details
3. Finally, analyze or summarize the collected information

Without AGS constraints, the agent might skip steps or perform them in an incorrect order, leading to incomplete or inaccurate results.
With AGS we can design a graph that enforces the correct sequence of operations without limiting the agent's ability to make decisions.

This example shows how AGS enforces the correct sequence of operations, ensuring data is gathered methodically and reliably.

<Accordion title="Key Benefits">
- **Bounded autonomy**: Agents make decisions within your constraints
- **Logical gatekeeping**: Ensures prerequisites are met before advancing
- **Reduced hallucinations**: Prevents agents from making up data they should retrieve
- **Workflow optimization**: Creates efficient paths for multi-step tasks
- **Simplified maintenance**: Easier to update agent behavior by modifying the graph
</Accordion>

## Implementation Methods

You can create agent graphs using either the visual UI or programmatically with the SDK. Both approaches offer the same functionality, with the visual builder being more intuitive for non-developers and the SDK providing more flexibility for programmers.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using the Visual Builder">
    The xpander.ai UI provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating agent graphs:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Access the Graph Builder">
        Navigate to your agent in the xpander.ai dashboard and select the "Graph" tab
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Add Operations">
        Drag operations from the sidebar into your graph workspace
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Create Connections">
        Draw lines between operations to establish dependencies
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Test Your Graph">
        Use the interface options to test your agent with different invocation methods
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Deploy">
        Save changes to deploy your updated graph
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Tip>
    The visual builder gives you all the power of AGS without writing code, making it accessible to both developers and non-developers.

    <Accordion title="Advanced UI Techniques">
      ### Multiple Prerequisites
      
      To create operations that require multiple previous steps:
      
      1. Drag all prerequisite operations into your graph
      2. Draw connection lines from each prerequisite to the dependent operation
      3. The dependent operation will only become available after all prerequisites are completed
      
      ### Creating Multiple Paths
      
      To create branching execution paths:
      
      1. Add a "parent" operation (like a search operation)
      2. Add multiple "child" operations that can follow
      3. Draw connections from the parent to each possible child
      4. The agent can choose which path to take after completing the parent operation
      
      ### Example: Agent Structure in UI
      
      A well-structured agent graph typically demonstrates:
      
      - **Top Level**: Operations that run first (initial searches, data gathering)
      - **Middle Level**: Operations that depend on top-level results
      - **Bottom Level**: Operations that require specific data from previous steps
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Using the SDK">
    The SDK offers a programmatic approach that provides the same capabilities as the visual builder, but with the flexibility to create and modify graphs through code:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add Operations to Your Agent">
        ```python
        # Attach operations to your agent
        agent.attach_operations(operations=[operation1, operation2])
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create Graph Nodes">
        ```python
        # Create graph nodes from operations
        node1 = agent.graph.add_node(
            GraphItem(
                agent=agent,
                item_id=operation1.id_to_use_on_graph,
                name=operation1.name
            )
        )
        
        node2 = agent.graph.add_node(
            GraphItem(
                agent=agent,
                item_id=operation2.id_to_use_on_graph,
                name=operation2.name
            )
        )
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Define Hierarchical Constraints">
        ```python
        # Create a hierarchical relationship
        # The agent must use node1 before it can use node2
        node1.connect([node2])
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Deploy Your Agent">
        ```python
        # Deploy the agent with the defined graph structure
        agent.sync()
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Creating a Graph Example

    Here's an example of creating a workflow graph with the SDK:

    ```python
    from xpander_sdk import XpanderClient, GraphItem
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load environment variables
    load_dotenv()

    # Initialize client
    xpander_client = XpanderClient(api_key=os.environ['XPANDER_API_KEY'])

    # Get the agent
    agent = xpander_client.agents.get(agent_id=os.environ.get('XPANDER_AGENT_ID'))

    # Retrieve operations from an interface
    available_interfaces = agent.retrieve_agentic_interfaces()
    search_interface = next((interface for interface in available_interfaces 
                            if 'search' in interface.name.lower()), None)
    
    if search_interface:
        search_operations = agent.retrieve_agentic_operations(agentic_interface=search_interface)
        
        # Attach needed operations to the agent
        agent.attach_operations(operations=search_operations)
        agent.sync()  # Apply the operation attachment
        
        # Create graph nodes
        nodes = []
        for operation in search_operations:
            node = agent.graph.add_node(
                GraphItem(
                    agent=agent,
                    item_id=operation.id_to_use_on_graph,
                    name=operation.name
                )
            )
            nodes.append(node)
        
        # Create relationships between nodes
        if len(nodes) >= 2:
            # Create a simple linear workflow
            nodes[0].connect([nodes[1]])
            
            # Apply the changes
            agent.sync()
    ```

    ### Real-world Example: Meeting Recorder Agent

    This example shows how to initialize a basic agent for a meeting recording application:

    ```python
    from xpander_sdk import XpanderClient, LLMProvider, Tokens, LLMTokens
    from openai import OpenAI
    import datetime
    import time
    
    class MeetingAgent:
        def __init__(self, openai_api_key, xpander_api_key, agent_id):
            self.agent_id = agent_id
            self.xpander_client = XpanderClient(api_key=xpander_api_key)
            self.openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)
            self.agent = self.xpander_client.agents.get(agent_id=self.agent_id)
        
        def run(self, prompt=None, thread_id=None):
            """Run the agent with the given prompt"""
            # Create task with thread management
            self.agent.add_task(
                input=prompt or "Check the status of all recorded meetings.", 
                thread_id=thread_id if thread_id else None
            )
            
            # Run the agent execution loop
            while not self.agent.is_finished():
                response = self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                    model="gpt-4o",
                    messages=self.agent.messages,
                    tools=self.agent.get_tools(llm_provider=LLMProvider.OPEN_AI),
                    tool_choice=self.agent.tool_choice,
                    temperature=0.0
                )
                
                self.agent.add_messages(response.model_dump())
                
                tool_calls = XpanderClient.extract_tool_calls(
                    llm_response=response.model_dump(),
                    llm_provider=LLMProvider.OPEN_AI
                )
                
                if tool_calls:
                    self.agent.run_tools(tool_calls=tool_calls)
                    
            # Process results
            result = self.agent.retrieve_execution_result()
            return result.result, result.memory_thread_id
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

<Accordion title="Best Practices">
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic dependencies before adding complexity
- **Test incrementally**: Verify each operation works before adding constraints
- **Document your design**: Keep track of the relationships you define
- **Consider edge cases**: Plan for how the agent should handle operation failures
- **Balance structure and flexibility**: Define necessary constraints without over-restricting
- **Design for user intent**: Structure workflows around common user requests
- **Verify sync calls**: Ensure `agent.sync()` is called after every graph modification
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Common Issues">
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Agent ignores constraints | Ensure you've called `agent.sync()` after defining relationships |
| Operations unavailable | Check that all operations are properly attached to the agent |
| Circular dependencies | Look for cycles in your graph that might prevent execution |
| Unintended restrictions | Verify constraints don't block valid execution paths |
| Changes not applied | Verify that `agent.sync()` is called after making graph modifications |
| Missing prerequisites | Ensure all node requirements are properly connected |
</Accordion>
