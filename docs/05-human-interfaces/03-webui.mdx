# Web UI Overview

The xpander.ai Web UI, powered by ChainLit, allows you to deploy your AI agents with beautiful, customizable web interfaces. This feature makes it easy to create production-ready user interfaces without extensive frontend development.

<Info>
The Web UI is fully managed by xpander.ai, handling all the complexities of user authentication, thread management, and state persistence across sessions.
</Info>

## Key Features

The Web UI provides a rich set of capabilities that make your AI agents accessible through professional interfaces:

**Instant UI Generation**: Create a professional web interface for your agents in minutes without writing frontend code.

**Thread Management**: Create and manage multiple conversation threads for organized discussions and parallel conversations.

**Conversation Starters**: Define presets to guide users on how to interact with your agent and showcase its capabilities.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your agent">
    First, create and configure your agent through the xpander.ai platform. Your agent should have all the necessary tools and capabilities defined before setting up the Web UI.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Web UI">
    In the agent configuration panel, navigate to the "Human Interfaces" tab and select "Web UI".
    
    Here you can configure:
    - Title and description
    - Conversation starters
    - Appearance settings
    - Authentication options

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and deploy">
    Once you've configured your Web UI settings, save your changes and deploy your agent using the "Deploy" button in the main interface.
    
    This will generate a URL where your agent's web interface is accessible. You can share this URL with intended users or embed it in existing applications.
    
    <Info>
    Access to these web interface links is restricted to users within your organization only.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication Options

The xpander.ai Web UI supports multiple authentication methods to secure your agent interfaces:

<Accordion title="Platform Authentication">
Leverage xpander.ai's built-in user management system for seamless authentication. This option provides:

- User registration and login flows
- Password management and recovery
- Session management across devices
- User profile and preference storage

This is the recommended approach for most deployments as it requires minimal configuration while providing robust security.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SSO Integration">
Connect with enterprise identity providers to leverage your existing authentication infrastructure:

- Support for SAML and OAuth 2.0 protocols
- Integrations with popular providers like Okta, Auth0, and Azure AD
- Role mapping from your identity provider to xpander.ai permissions
- Automatic user provisioning based on SSO attributes

SSO integration is ideal for enterprise deployments where centralized identity management is required.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom Auth Rules (Coming Soon)">
Define granular access controls based on user attributes:

- Create rule-based access policies
- Control access based on user roles, groups, or custom attributes
- Implement time-based restrictions (working hours, temporary access)
- Geographical access limitations

Custom auth rules provide the most flexibility for organizations with complex security requirements.
</Accordion>

Authentication settings can be configured in the "Security" section of the Web UI configuration panel.

## Customization Options

### UI Configuration

The Web UI can be customized through the configuration panel to match your brand and preferences:

<Accordion title="Basic Settings">
Configure the fundamental aspects of your web interface:

**Title**: The name displayed in the UI header, browser tab, and search results.

**Description**: A brief explanation of your agent's purpose that helps users understand its capabilities.

**Conversation Starters**: Suggested prompts that appear when users first access your agent, guiding them to productive interactions.
</Accordion>

## Embedding in Existing Applications

You can embed your agent's Web UI in existing applications using a standard iframe:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://your-agent-url.xpander.ai" 
  width="100%" 
  height="600px"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

<Info>
When embedding the Web UI, authentication settings still apply. Users will need to authenticate according to your configured settings before interacting with the embedded interface.
</Info>

## Custom UI Implementation

For teams that need complete control over the user interface, xpander.ai provides access to the underlying thread and state management systems:

<Accordion title="Thread Management API">
Access conversation threads programmatically to build custom interfaces with these capabilities:

**Thread Creation**: Initiate new conversation threads with specific contexts or parameters.

**Message History**: Retrieve complete or filtered message history for display in custom UIs.

**Context Tracking**: Access and modify conversation context to maintain coherent interactions.

**Custom Rendering**: Implement specialized rendering logic for domain-specific message types.

The Thread Management API enables you to maintain the benefits of xpander.ai's conversation handling while implementing completely custom interfaces.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="State Management Integration">
Leverage xpander.ai's robust state management system in your custom UIs:

**State Access**: Query and modify agent state programmatically through secure APIs.

**Cross-Client Synchronization**: Keep state consistent across multiple clients and devices.

**Session Persistence**: Maintain state between user sessions for continuous experiences.

**Multi-Step Interactions**: Build complex, stateful interactions with clear progression.

This integration provides the foundation for creating sophisticated applications that maintain context across user interactions.
</Accordion>

These APIs enable development teams to create completely custom interfaces while leveraging xpander.ai's production-grade backend infrastructure.
