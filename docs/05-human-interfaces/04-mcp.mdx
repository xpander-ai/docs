The xpander.ai SDK supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing you to extend Claude and other compatible AI assistants with xpander's agentic interfaces natively.

### Configuring MCP Server for Claude Desktop

With xpander.ai's native MCP support, you can easily integrate xpander's agentic interfaces directly into Claude and other compatible AI assistants:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Agentic Interfaces Settings">
    Open https://app.xpander.ai
    In the settings menu, click on "Agentic Interfaces".

  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on MCP Configuration">
    Find and click on the "MCP Configuration" option.
    <Frame>![alt text](/static/images/screenshots/MCP%20Configuration.png)</Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the MCP Server to Claude">
    Add a configuration snippet like the following, replacing the URL with your specific Xpander MCP endpoint: (The file is located at '~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json')

    ```json

    {
      "globalShortcut": "Alt+Space",
      "mcpServers": {
        "linkedin": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "xpander-mcp-remote",
            "https://mcp.xpander.ai/f5dd774a-b5dc-4f2b-a49a-08719abcaa0b/IhPLk2Cu5BXw5BmV********2pD6O5E3/"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  The MCP URL contains your API key, so never share it publicly. Treat it as a sensitive credential.
</Warning>

You can add multiple MCP servers to your configuration file by adding them to the `mcpServers` object. Each server should have a unique key:

```json
{
  "globalShortcut": "Alt+Space",
  "mcpServers": {
    "linkedin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "xpander-mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-linkedin-mcp-url/"
      ]
    },
    "gmail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "xpander-mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-gmail-mcp-url/"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Instead of manually editing the configuration file, you can use the MCP installer by adding this to your configuration file at '~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json':
  ```json
  "mcp-installer": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "@anaisbetts/mcp-installer"
    ]
  }
  ```
  Then simply ask Claude to install your MCP URL, and it will handle the installation automatically.
</Tip>

### Working with Authenticated Connectors

If you've already configured authentication for connectors in xpander.ai (such as Gmail, LinkedIn, or other services), they will work automatically with the provided MCP URL without requiring additional authentication steps in Claude.

For example, if you've already connected your Gmail account in xpander.ai:

1. Add the xpander MCP configuration to Claude as shown above
2. You can immediately use Gmail capabilities in Claude through natural language
3. No additional authentication steps are needed in Claude

### Multiple Interface Configuration

You can configure multiple interfaces in a single MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "linkedin": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "xpander-mcp-remote",
      "https://mcp.xpander.ai/f5dd774a-b5dc-4f2b-a49a-08719abcaa0b/IhPLk2Cu5B****pD6O5E3/"
    ]
  },
  "gmail": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "xpander-mcp-remote",
      "https://mcp.xpander.ai/f5dd774a-b5dc-4f2b-a49a-08719abcaa0b/IhPLk2Cu5B********92pD6O5E3/"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Testing Your MCP Integration

Once configured, you can test your integration by asking Claude to perform actions using the connected service:

1. For LinkedIn: "Can you search for AI Product Managers on LinkedIn?"
2. For Gmail: "Could you check my recent unread emails?"
3. For Weather: "What's the weather like in San Francisco today?"

Claude will seamlessly connect to the xpander MCP server and utilize its agentic interfaces to fulfill your requests.
