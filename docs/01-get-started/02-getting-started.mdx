## Set Up Your Environment

Before diving into xpander.ai, let's set up your development environment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a project and virtual environment">
    Create a new project directory and set up a Python virtual environment:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir my_project
    cd my_project
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate the virtual environment">
    Do this every time you start a new terminal session:
    
    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install the xpander SDK">
    Install the xpander SDK using pip:
    
    ```bash
    pip install xpander-sdk
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up your API keys">
    If you don't have API keys, create them in the respective platforms:
    
    ```bash
    # Set environment variables
    export XPANDER_API_KEY=xpd_sk_...
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_...  # If you'll be using OpenAI models
    
    # Alternative: create a .env file
    echo "XPANDER_API_KEY=xpd_sk_..." >> .env
    echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_..." >> .env
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Model & Framework Flexibility

xpander.ai is completely model-agnostic and framework-agnostic, giving you maximum flexibility in how you build and deploy your AI agents:

- **No-Code Option**: The xpander platform UI demonstrated above lets you create fully functional agents without writing a single line of code. Simply define your agent through the AI Builder interface, and the platform handles the rest.

- **Any LLM Model**: Use OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, or other LLM providers based on your specific needs and preferences.

- **Any Agent Framework**: Seamlessly integrate with popular agent frameworks like LlamaIndex, CrewAI, or HuggingFace's Smoleagents while leveraging xpander's enhanced capabilities.

For more advanced code-based implementations after creating your agent in the platform:
- See [Start with LLM Models](/docs/01-get-started/02-llm-models) for direct integration with various LLM providers
- See [Start with Agent Frameworks](/docs/01-get-started/03-agent-frameworks) for using xpander with existing agent frameworks
