    Build AI agents faster by focusing exclusively on agent logic rather than infrastructure
    
    ```python Basic Agent Loop
    # Get your agent
    agent = xpander.agents.get(agent_id=os.getenv("XPANDER_AGENT_ID"))
    
    # Manage AI state with a single API (is_finished)
    while not agent.is_finished():
        # Get LLM response
        response = llm_provider.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4.1",
            messages=agent.messages,  # Auto-translate messages object between frameworks
            tools=agent.get_tools(),  # Auto-translate tools object between frameworks
        )

        # Extract tool calls from the AI response
        tool_calls = agent.extract_tool_calls(
            llm_response=response.model_dump()
        )

        # Securely run the AI choices in xpander cloud after validating generated payloads
        # Auto-enforce API Rules and dependencies
        agent.run_tools(tool_calls=tool_calls)

    # Asynchronously load the agent result for long-running multi-step tasks
    task_result = agent.retrieve_execution_result()
    ```
