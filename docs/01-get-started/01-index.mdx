xpander.ai is an Agentic Platform that simplifies how you build, enhance, and deploy AI agents. It works with popular frameworks (SmolAgents, LangGraph) and LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) without vendor lock-in.

The platform handles the complex infrastructure needed for managing thousands of user interactions, maintaining complex agent states, and orchestrating multi-step agent workflows. This comprehensive approach lets developers focus exclusively on agent logic rather than worrying about underlying infrastructure concerns.

# Key Platform Features

xpander.ai is designed with two core principles:

1. **Focus on agent logic, not infrastructure**: We handle complex state management, scaling, and deployment concerns so you can focus on what your agents do.

2. **Framework and provider independence**: Build once and deploy with any LLM provider or agent framework without rewriting your code.

      </Step>

      <Step title="Connect to your agent programmatically">
        The following steps show how to execute your agent locally, with full control over the execution loop.
        
        First, initialize the clients:
        
        ```python
        from xpander import XpanderClient
        from openai import OpenAI

        # Initialize clients
        xpander_client = XpanderClient(api_key=XPANDER_API_KEY)
        openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

        # Get your agent
        agent = xpander_client.agents.get(agent_id=XPANDER_AGENT_ID)
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Create a task and initialize state">
        Create an immutable task for the agent. Tasks are immutable by design, allowing you to track state changes throughout execution:
        
        ```python
        # Create a task for the agent
        task1 = agent.add_task("""
        Summarize the last 24 hours top hackernews
        """)

        # Initialize agent memory with the task
        agent.memory.init_messages(
            input=agent.execution.input_message,
            instructions=agent.instructions
        )
        ```
        
        <Accordion title="Understanding Task Creation and State Initialization">
        When you create a task with `agent.add_task()`, xpander:
        
        1. Creates an immutable task record that persists throughout execution
        2. Generates a unique execution ID to track this specific agent run
        3. Sets up an initial input message that becomes available as `agent.execution.input_message`
        
        The `agent.memory.init_messages()` call then:
        
        1. Initializes the agent's working memory with the task input and instructions
        2. Establishes the initial state for the agent's execution
        3. Prepares the message history that will be sent to the LLM
        
        The immutability of tasks ensures you always have a reliable record of what was requested, while the memory system handles the evolving state of the agent as it works. This separation of concerns allows for reliable tracking, debugging, and auditing of agent behavior.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Agent Input Message Format">
        ```json
        {
          "content": "Summarize the last 24 hours top hackernews",
          "role": "user"
        }
        ```
        
        The input message follows a standard chat format with a role and content. This is automatically generated from your task description and becomes available as `agent.execution.input_message`.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Agent Instructions Format">
        ```json
        {
          "general": "You are a Hacker News summarization agent. Retrieve top stories, fetch details, and generate concise summaries using Perplexity AI. Format and present the summarized news. End with xpfinish-agent-execution-finished.\n        IMPORTANT: when making a sub-task (with input_task), make sure to append all related \n        information relevant for the sub-task. For instance, if the sub-task is about sending \n        an email with tags, ensure the tags and any required data are included in the input_task.\n        \n        - Execute tools as needed to complete tasks.  \n        - If a tool fails 3 times, execution stalls, or no tool is called for an extended period, stop immediately and report the issue along with any relevant results or errors.\n        ",
          "goal": "Retrieve top stories from Hacker News, fetch detailed content for each story, generate concise summaries, and format the results for presentation. Finalize with xpfinish-agent-execution-finished, returning the summarized news articles in the 'results'.",
          "role": "Expert in retrieving and processing Hacker News stories, responsible for fetching top stories and their details"
        }
        ```
        
        The instructions object provides comprehensive guidance to the agent:
        - `general`: Overall instructions, constraints, and operational guidelines
        - `goal`: Specific objective the agent needs to accomplish
        - `role`: Identity and responsibilities the agent should assume
        
        These instructions are used to initialize the agent's memory and guide its decision-making throughout execution.
        </Accordion>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Execute the agent loop locally (optional)">
        Run the agent execution loop locally. The `is_finished()` method allows you to check if the agent has completed its task, errored out, or is still processing:
        
        ```python
        # Run the agent until completion
        while not agent.is_finished():
            # Get LLM response with available tools
            response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4o",
                messages=agent.messages,
                tools=agent.get_tools(),
                tool_choice=agent.tool_choice,
                temperature=0.0
            )
                    
            # Process LLM response
            agent.add_messages(response.model_dump())
            
            # Extract and run tool calls
            tool_calls = XpanderClient.extract_tool_calls(llm_response=response.model_dump())
            agent.run_tools(tool_calls=tool_calls)
        ```
        
        The `is_finished()` API checks the execution state of the agent, enabling you to control the execution loop programmatically. This approach gives you full visibility into the agent's execution process.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Retrieve execution results">
        Once execution is complete, you can retrieve the immutable execution result:
        
        ```python
        # Get final results
        execution_result = agent.retrieve_execution_result()
        print("Status:", execution_result.status)
        print("Result:", execution_result.result)
        ```
        
        The execution result is immutable, meaning it can be safely retrieved at any point during or after execution without affecting the agent's state. This design allows you to monitor progress or record results while the agent continues processing.

    ## Hello World Example with CLI

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the CLI">
