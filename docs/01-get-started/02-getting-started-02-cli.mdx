## Creating Your First Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new agent">
    Create your agent using the CLI:

    ```bash
    xpander agent new
    ```

    <Tip>
    The CLI will prompt you to select from available templates. The **Agno template** is ideal for general-purpose conversational agents and provides a solid foundation for most use cases, including document processing, Q&A systems, and workflow automation.

  <Step title="Configure environment variables">
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following credentials:

    ```txt .env file
    XPANDER_API_KEY=your_xpander_api_key  # From the xpander login output
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    OPENAI_MODEL_ID=gpt-4.1
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Your Agent

With your agent created, you can now work with it in several ways:

1. **Using the SDK in your code**: Implement the agent loop and integrate with your application
2. **Stream events from the cloud**: Set up a handler to receive events from xpander.ai
3. **Deploy to the cloud**: Host your agent in the xpander.ai cloud

For detailed code examples and step-by-step implementation instructions, see our dedicated [Instrument & Run AI Agents](/docs/01-get-started/03-instrument-agents) guide.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues with `xpander agent new`

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Network Connectivity Problems">
    **Symptoms**: Connection timeouts, DNS resolution errors, or "Unable to reach xpander.ai" messages.
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Check your internet connection
    - Verify you can access https://api.xpander.ai in your browser
    - If behind a corporate firewall, ensure the following domains are whitelisted:

      - `registry.npmjs.org` (for CLI updates)
    - Try using a different network or mobile hotspot to isolate network issues
  </Accordion>

    - Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions to create agents
    - Check that your organization ID is properly detected during configuration
