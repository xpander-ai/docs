## Agent Templates

The xpander CLI provides several pre-built agent templates to accelerate development:

### Available Templates

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Agno Framework" icon="python">
    A Python framework for building multi-agent systems that enables integration of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers as tools for AI agents. Ideal for complex workflows requiring multiple specialized agents.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Custom Templates" icon="template">
    Pre-configured agents for specific use cases including document processing, workflow automation, data analysis, and enterprise integrations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Template Benefits

- **Faster Development**: Start with proven patterns and configurations
- **Best Practices**: Templates follow established conventions and security guidelines  
- **Extensibility**: Easily customize templates for your specific requirements
- **Integration Ready**: Templates come with common tool integrations pre-configured

<Info>
Agent templates can be further customized through the [Agent Builder](/docs/02-agent-builder/01-adding-tools-to-agents) interface after creation.
</Info>

## Working with Your Agent

With your agent created, you can now work with it in several ways:

1. **Using the SDK in your code**: Implement the agent loop and integrate with your application
2. **Stream events from the cloud**: Set up a handler to receive events from xpander.ai
3. **Deploy to the cloud**: Host your agent in the xpander.ai cloud

For detailed code examples and step-by-step implementation instructions, see our dedicated [Instrument & Run AI Agents](/docs/01-get-started/03-instrument-agents) guide.
