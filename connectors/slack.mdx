- **Direct Messaging**: Send private messages to individuals or groups for more focused discussions.

- **Huddles**: Initiate quick audio or video calls within channels or direct messages to facilitate real-time conversations.

- **File Sharing**: Easily share documents, images, and other files within conversations, with the ability to integrate with services like Google Drive and Dropbox.

- **Integrations**: Connect with over 2,400 third-party applications, including Google Calendar, Asana, and Salesforce, to centralize your workflow.

- **Searchable History**: Access and search through past messages and files, ensuring important information is always retrievable.

- **Automation**: Utilize tools like Workflow Builder to automate repetitive tasks and processes, enhancing efficiency.
