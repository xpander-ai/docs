## About Recall.ai

Recall.ai is a developer-focused platform that offers a universal API for accessing and processing data from virtual meetings across platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Webex, Slack Huddles, and GoTo Meeting. It enables developers to integrate real-time and post-meeting data—such as audio, video, transcripts, and metadata—into their applications with minimal effort.

Key features include:

- **Unified API Across Platforms**: Simplifies integration by providing a single API to access data from various video conferencing platforms, even those without official APIs, requiring only the meeting URL. 

- **Real-Time Data Access**: Offers real-time audio and video streams with low latency (approximately 200ms), enabling functionalities like live transcription and speaker identification. 

- **Comprehensive Metadata Retrieval**: Provides detailed meeting metadata, including participant names, roles, join times, speaking durations, and screen-sharing events. 

- **Rapid Deployment**: Allows developers to deploy meeting bots and integrate functionalities in days rather than months, significantly reducing development time and resources.
