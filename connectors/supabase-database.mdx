## About Supabase Database

Supabase database is a fully managed PostgreSQL instance enriched with real-time capabilities and developer-friendly tools, making it a robust solution for modern application development.

Key features include:

- **Full PostgreSQL Access**: Each Supabase project includes a dedicated PostgreSQL database, providing developers with the full power and flexibility of Postgres, including advanced data types, indexing, and SQL support.

- **Realtime Capabilities**: Supabase extends PostgreSQL with real-time functionality using its Realtime Server. This allows applications to listen to database changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and respond instantly, enabling features like live dashboards and collaborative tools. 

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Supabase leverages PostgreSQL's RLS to provide fine-grained access control, ensuring that users can only access data they're authorized to see. 

- **Built-in Table Editor**: The Supabase Dashboard offers a user-friendly table editor, allowing developers to create and manage tables without writing SQL, making database management more accessible. 

- **Database Backups**: Supabase automatically manages database backups, providing peace of mind and data safety without manual intervention. 

- **Extensions Support**: Developers can enhance their databases by enabling PostgreSQL extensions directly from the Supabase Dashboard, adding functionalities like full-text search, GIS support, and more.
