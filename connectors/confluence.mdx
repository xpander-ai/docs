- **Integration with Atlassian Tools**: Confluence integrates seamlessly with other Atlassian products like Jira, enhancing project tracking and collaboration.

- **Templates and Macros**: It offers a variety of templates and macros to streamline content creation and formatting.

    ### Generate a Confluence API Key

    3. Click **Create API token**, give it a name and set an expiration date.  
    4. Your API key will be displayed—copy it somewhere safe.  
    5. Encode the combination of your email address and API key in base64 using the format:  
       `your@email.com:your-api-key`  
       You can do this in one of two ways:  
       - Run the following command in your terminal:
         ```
         echo -n 'your@email.com:your-api-token' | base64
         ```
       - Or use an [online base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/).
