## About Calendly

Calendly is an online scheduling tool that helps individuals and businesses streamline the process of setting up meetings and appointments. Instead of the back-and-forth emails to find a mutually available time, Calendly allows users to:

- Share a personalized link with others (e.g., calendly.com/yourname)

- Let invitees book time based on the user's availability

- Sync with calendars like Google, Outlook, or iCloud to avoid double-booking
