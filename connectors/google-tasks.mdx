## About Google Tasks

Google Tasks is a free, minimalist task management tool developed by Google, designed to help users create and manage to-do lists across devices.

Key features include:

- **Task Creation & Organization**: Quickly add tasks with titles, optional descriptions, due dates, and subtasks. Tasks can be organized into multiple lists to manage different projects or categories.

- **Due Dates & Reminders**: Assign due dates and times to tasks, which then appear in your Google Calendar. You can also set tasks to repeat on a regular schedule.

- **Integration with Gmail & Calendar**: Convert emails into tasks directly from Gmail, and view tasks alongside events in Google Calendar.

- **Cross-Device Sync**: Access and manage your tasks on the web or through the mobile app on Android and iOS devices, with all data syncing across platforms.

- **Simple Interface**: Google Tasks offers a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy to create, organize, and manage tasks.
