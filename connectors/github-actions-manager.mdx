## About Github Actions Manager

GitHub is a cloud-based platform designed for developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code.

GitHub Actions, enabling developers to automate workflows, manage runners, handle artifacts, and more.

Key features of Github Actions Manager include:

- **Workflows**: Manage and control workflow configurations within a repository.

- **Workflow Runs**: Track, re-run, cancel, or delete specific executions of workflows.

- **Jobs**: Inspect and monitor individual jobs within a workflow run, including logs.

- **Artifacts**: Handle generated build artifacts—list, download, or delete them as needed.

- **Secrets**: Securely manage sensitive values (like tokens) used in workflows.

- **Variables**: Store and manage non-sensitive config values for workflows.

- **Runners**: Manage GitHub-hosted or self-hosted machines that execute workflows.

- **Permissions**: Control what actions and workflows are allowed and who can run them.
