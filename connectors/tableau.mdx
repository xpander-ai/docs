## About Tableau

Tableau is a visual analytics platform that empowers individuals and organizations to explore and understand data through interactive visualizations.

Key features include:

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Drag-and-drop interface to create dashboards, charts, graphs, and maps without coding.

- **Wide Data Connectivity**: Connects to multiple data sources such as Relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle), cloud services (Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift, Snowflake), spreadsheets (Excel, CSV, Google Sheets), and web connectors (APIs).

- **Geospatial & Mapping Capabilities**: Built-in geocoding and mapping for creating geographic visualizations.

- **Natural Language & AI Features**: Natural language queries for instant insights and AI-driven explanations of outliers and patterns.

- **Dashboard Interactivity**: Filters, actions, and parameters for interactive dashboards.

    6. Copy your personal access token and save it securely before closing the dialog box.  
    7. Obtain an authentication token by executing the following request:

    ```
    curl -X POST "https://{YOUR_SERVER_NAME}/api/3.26/auth/signin" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "credentials": {
        "personalAccessTokenName": "YOUR_PAT_NAME",
        "personalAccessTokenSecret": "YOUR_PAT_SECRET",
        "site": {
            "contentUrl": "YOUR_SITE_NAME"
        }
        }
    }'
    ```
    
    Replace **personalAccessTokenName** and **personalAccessTokenSecret** with the token name and secret you obtained above.

    You can find your server name and site name in your Tableau URL. For example, if your URL is: https://dub01.online.tableau.com/#/site/xpandersandbox2-577b145t/, then:
    - Server name: dub01.online.tableau.com
    - Site name: xpandersandbox2-577b145t

    8. Save the authentication token you obtained somewhere safe.

Can you show me all the sites available in our Tableau environment and their configuration details?
````

```
Can you retrieve the current data for metric {metric_id} in site {site_id} to analyze recent performance trends?
