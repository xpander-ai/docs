## About Power BI

Power BI is Microsoft's cloud-based business intelligence (BI) platform that enables users to connect to a wide range of data sources, transform and model data, and create rich visual reports and dashboards.

Key features include:

- **Data connectivity**: Connect to 100+ data sources including Excel, SQL, Azure, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Salesforce, PDFs, and more.

- **Power Query**: Integrated ETL engine (also in Excel/Dataflows) to clean, transform, and mash up data using M‑code.

- **Data modeling with DAX**: Use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to build measures, calculated columns, dynamic filters, and power calculations.

- **Visualizatio**: Drag‑and‑drop visuals, custom visuals via Marketplace, interactive dashboards, report page, Q&A (natural‑language querying), paginated reports, goals/KPI tracking.

## Authentication Options

Below are possible authentication options you can choose:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Built-in xpander.ai Auth">

    The simplest way to connect Power BI is by using xpander.ai's built-in authentication:

    1. Go to the **Connectors** section in the sidebar of your xpander.ai dashboard.  
    2. Select **Power BI** from the available integrations.  
    3. Click **Sign in with Power BI**.  
    4. Grant xpander.ai permission to access your account.  
    5. Your Power BI integration is now ready to use.

  <Tab title="API Access">

    ### Generate a Power BI API Token

    1. Log in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).  
    2. Create and register an app to access the Power BI API. To do this, in the sidebar, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.  

   ![Img 1](/images/connectors/power-bi/img_1.png)

    3. Under the **Manage** section, select **App registrations** and click **New registration**.  

   ![Img 2](/images/connectors/power-bi/img_2.png)

    4. Provide an app name and choose the **Supported account types** option that fits your use case. Then, click **Register**.  
    5. After creating the app, note down the **Client ID** and **Tenant ID**. You’ll need these credentials later to obtain an access token.  
    6. In **Microsoft Entra ID**, go to **App registrations** > **All applications**, and select your newly created app.  

   ![Img 3](/images/connectors/power-bi/img_3.png)

    7. Under **Manage**, select **Certificates & secrets**, then click **New client secret**. Save the secret value securely.  

   ![Img 4](/images/connectors/power-bi/img_4.png)

    8. Ensure your app does **not** have any admin-consent-required permissions. Follow [these steps in the Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/enable-service-principal-admin-apis#how-to-check-if-your-app-has-admin-consent-required-permissions) to verify.  

    9. In your Power BI account, enable the Power BI Service admin settings by following [Step 3 in this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded/embed-service-principal?tabs=azure-portal#step-3---enable-the-power-bi-service-admin-settings).  

    10. In the dashboard of your desired Power BI workspace, go to **Manage access** and add your newly created app as a **Member** or **Admin** by searching for its name.  

    ![Img 5](/images/connectors/power-bi/img_5.png)

    11. Finally, obtain your access token by executing the following request:  

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
    -d "client_id=<YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID>" \
    -d "client_secret=<YOUR_SECRET_VALUE>" \
    -d "scope=https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default" \
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/<YOUR_APP_TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token
    ```

    Replace the placeholders with your credentials from previous steps, and store the access token securely.

## Integration of Power BI into AI Agent

Once you've configured your Power BI account with the authentication option(s) described above, you can integrate it into your AI agent with xpander.ai:

1. In your xpander.ai dashboard, go to the **Agent Configuration** tab and select **Tools**, then click **Add Tools**. 
2. Select **Connectors**.  
3. Choose **Power BI** with the same **connector name** you configured in the previous section (e.g., xpander-power-bi).  
4. Select the available Power BI operations that suit your use case.

## Expose Power BI as MCP Server

Alternatively, you can also expose your Power BI account as an MCP server. To do so:

1. Go to the **Connectors** section in the sidebar of your xpander.ai dashboard.  
2. Select **Power BI** with the same **connector name** you configured in the previous section (e.g., xpander-power-bi).  
3. Click **MCP Configuration**.  
4. Enter the MCP configuration into the appropriate settings of the client app you want to use (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, etc.).
