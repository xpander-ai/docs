## About Google Calendar

Google Calendar is a free, cloud-based time-management and scheduling service developed by Google.

Key features include:

- **Event Creation & Management**: Schedule one-time or recurring events, set start and end times, add locations, and invite guests. You can also set reminders via email or push notifications.

- **Multiple Calendar Support**: Create and manage multiple calendars within your account to separate work, personal, or project-specific events. Each calendar can be color-coded for easy identification. 

- **Sharing & Collaboration**: Share your calendar with others, allowing them to view or edit events. This is particularly useful for coordinating schedules within teams or families.

- **Integration with Google Services**: Events from Gmail (like flight or hotel reservations) are automatically added to your calendar. It also integrates with Google Meet for video conferencing.

- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Accessible via web browsers and dedicated apps for Android and iOS, ensuring your schedule is always at your fingertips.

- **Customizable Views**: Switch between daily, weekly, monthly, or agenda views to suit your planning needs.
