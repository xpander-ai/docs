    3. Click **Create API token**, give it a name and set an expiration date.  
    4. Your API key will be displayedâ€”copy it somewhere safe.  
    5. Encode the combination of your email address and API key in base64 using the format:

       You can do this in one of two ways:  
       - Run the following command in your terminal:
         ```
         echo -n 'your@email.com:your-api-token' | base64
         ```
       - Or use an [online base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/).
