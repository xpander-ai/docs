- **Create an Issue**: Initiate a new issue in a specified repository by providing necessary details like title, body, and labels.

- **Get an Issue**: Fetch detailed information about a specific issue using its number within a repository.

- **Update an Issue**: Modify attributes of an existing issue, such as title, body, state (open or closed), labels, and assignees.

- **Lock/Unlock an Issue**: Restrict or allow further comments on an issue to manage discussions effectively.
