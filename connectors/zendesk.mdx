    5. You'll now see your Zendesk API tokenâ€”copy and store it safely.  
    6. Combine your Zendesk email address and API token using the following format:  
       ```
       email_address/token:zendesk_token
       ```  
       Then, encode it in Base64. You can do this in a couple of ways:
       - Run the following command in your terminal (Linux/macOS):  
         ```
         echo -n 'email_address/token:zendesk_token' | base64
         ```
       - Use an [online Base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/).

    7. The encoded result will serve as your Zendesk API key.
