    ### Generate a Zoho API Key

    1. Log in to your [Zoho API console](https://accounts.zoho.com/signin?servicename=AaaServer&context=&serviceurl=https%3A%2F%2Fapi-console.zoho.com%2F).  
    2. Choose the type of application you want to create. In this example, we’ll create a **Self Client** app.

    3. Select **Self Client** and click **Create**.  
    4. You’ll see the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Next, you’ll need to generate an **authorization code**.  
    5. Go to the **Generate Code** tab. Under **Scope**, select the appropriate scopes for your app. You can find a full list in the [Zoho Creator documentation](https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/api/v2.1/oauth-overview.html).  
    6. Set the validity duration for the authorization code, then click **Create**.

    7. Copy and save your **authorization code**.  
    8. To get your access token, run the following request:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST <BASE-URL>/oauth/v2/token \
      -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
      -d "code=<AUTHORIZATION-CODE>" \
      -d "client_id=<CLIENT-ID>" \
      -d "client_secret=<CLIENT-SECRET>"
    ```

    Replace the placeholders with your actual values. You can find the `<BASE-URL>` for your Zoho account [here](http://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/serverinfo).
