    ### Generate Twilio API Key

    3. Combine the Account SID and Auth Token using the following format: `account_SID:Auth_token`, and encode it using Base64. You can do this in a few ways:  
    - Run this command: `echo -n '{account_SID}:{Auth_token}' | base64` (for Linux or macOS).  
    - Use an [online encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/).  
    4. The encoded result will serve as your Twilio API key.
