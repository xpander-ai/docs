The Docs Agent leverages Tool Calling through a built-in xpander.ai function to search and answer questions from Mintlify-powered documentation websites. This enables instant, accurate Q&A for your docs, right out of the box.

## When to use this template

Use this template when you want to provide instant, well-formatted answers from your documentation - whether for your internal team, your customer community, or shared Slack channels. With the [Slack Agents](/user-guide/task-sources/slack) feature, you can connect this AI Agent to your Slack workspaces or customer channels, delivering documentation answers directly where your users are. 

You can further enhance the agent by adding capabilities such as opening support tickets, scheduling calls, or implementing any custom workflows your organization needs.
