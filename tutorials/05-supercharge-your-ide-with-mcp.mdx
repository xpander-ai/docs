  **Tutorial Summary**

  - **Goal**: Create a custom GitHub MCP Server with Agentic RAG optimization
  - **Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes
  - **Prerequisites**: GitHub account, Cursor IDE, xpander.ai account
</Note>

üöÄ In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a powerful GitHub search agent with optimized Agentic RAG capabilities and expose it as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server to supercharge your Cursor IDE experience. By building this agent, you'll understand how to create practical AI tools that integrate seamlessly with your development workflow, improving coding efficiency and access to real-time code examples.

## üîç Creating Your GitHub Search Agent

### Step 1: Set up xpander.ai

1. Navigate to the [xpander.ai platform](https://app.xpander.ai):

   ```bash Terminal Command
   # Open in your browser
   open https://app.xpander.ai
   ```
2. Sign in with your existing credentials or sign up for a new account
3. In the left navigation menu, go to **Agents**
4. Click the **\+** **New Agent** button to open the Workbench
5. When prompted by the agent builder, click **Skip** (we'll create the agent manually for this tutorial)

### Step 2: Add GitHub Search Tools

1. Click on the **\+** (plus) button in your agent canvas
2. Select **Connectors** from the menu
3. Select **GitHub Search Manager**
4. Click **Sign in with GitHub Search Manager**

   <Frame>
     ![GitHub Search Manager Sign-in](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-23-50-36.png)
   </Frame>
5. Give the interface a name (like "github-search-your-name" or just "github-search")
6. Click **Save**

<Tip>
  After authorizing GitHub Search, you can see the available operations for this App in the right menu. You can add operations from this menu to your AI Agent, so they will be reflected as Tools in the AI Agent's runtime.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Add GitHub Operations

Add the following GitHub operations to your agent - select and confirm by clicking "Add to agent" at the bottom of the right selection menu.

- **Find Code Snippets by Query Terms** - `GET /search/code`
- **Find Repositories by Criteria** - `GET /search/repositories`
- **Search Topics by Criteria** - `GET /search/topics`
- **Find Users by Criteria** - `GET /search/users`
- **Search Commits by Criteria** - `GET /search/commits`

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Step 4: Configure Agent Settings

1. In the AI Workbench, click on the Gear Icon in the top-right corner
2. In the Agent Builder Settings panel, click on **Generate Details**
3. Enter the following prompt to generate your agent description:

   ```txt Prompt for generating agent
   You are GitHub-Search-Agent, an expert at searching and analyzing GitHub repositories, code, users, and topics. You have deep knowledge of GitHub's API and can provide concise, accurate information about code patterns, repository structures, and developer activities.
   ```

üëâ This step automatically generates the AI Agent instructions for us. Let's further optimize them to match our exact use-case.

4. Go to the "**Instructions**" section and define your agent's role, goal, and instructions:

   ```txt Role
   You are GitHub-Search-Agent, an expert at searching and analyzing GitHub repositories, code, users, and topics. You have deep knowledge of GitHub's API and can provide concise, accurate information about code patterns, repository structures, and developer activities.
   ```

   ```txt Goal
   Your goal is to help users find relevant code, repositories, and developers on GitHub to accelerate their development process. You should prioritize providing the most relevant results and explaining code patterns when found.
   ```

   ```txt Instructions
   1. When searching for code, focus on finding the most relevant implementations
   2. For repositories, highlight the most popular ones with good documentation
   3. When exploring user profiles, focus on their recent contributions and expertise
   4. Prefer repositories with higher star counts and recent activity
   5. For any search query, first try to understand what the user is looking for before running the search
   6. Always provide contextual information about why a result is relevant
   ```
5. Click **Save Changes** and close the settings window and then click **Deploy**.

Your agent should look similar to this:

</Frame>

## üß™ Testing Your Agent with Raw API Responses

Let's test your newly created GitHub search agent:

1. In the left pane of the builder interface, you'll find the testing area
2. Type the following query to search for topics:

   ```txt Prompt
   Search for topics in GitHub related to A2A and MCP
   ```
3. Look at the generated payload by clicking on it. You'll see something like:

   ```json Example AI Generated Payload
   {
      "bodyParams": {},
      "queryParams": {
         "q": "A2A MCP",
         "per-page": 10,
         "page": 1
      },
      "pathParams": {}
   }
   ```

   ```json Example response
   {
    "total_count": 2,
    "incomplete_results": false,
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "a2a-mcp",
            "created_at": "2025-04-30T00:52:27Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-04-30T00:52:27Z",
            "featured": false,
            "curated": false,
            "score": 1
        },
        {
            "name": "a2a-vs-mcp",
            "created_at": "2025-04-30T00:52:27Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-04-30T00:52:27Z",
            "featured": false,
            "curated": false,
            "score": 1
        }
    ]
   }
   ```

<Tip>
  Using the tester tab is extremely useful to find how the AI Agent executes tool calls, how it populates parameters, and what responses are returned from remote APIs.
</Tip>

4. Now try a repositories search in the testing area:

   ```txt Prompt
   Find cool repositories related to Agent 2 Agent and MCP
   ```

<Warning>
  Because the API response for this tool call is huge, it is not optimal for AI consumption and could fail (you might not see a response). Continue to the next step to see how Agentic RAG comes in to help filter and optimize these huge responses.
</Warning>

## üß† Optimizing Responses with Agentic RAG

### Optimizing Repository Search

Let's improve the repository search results using Agentic RAG:

1. You can configure specific tool calls. Click on the gear icon next to the **Find Repositories by Criteria** operation in the graph.

<Frame>
  ![Agentic RAG Configuration](/images/workshops/operation-card.png)
</Frame>

2. Click on **Advanced** and then switch to **Raw Editor** (this allows the AI to send natural language queries, and the server will perform semantic search on the API response)
3. Configure the search and return fields:

   Searchable Fields (fields the AI can search against):

   ```json Searchable Fields Configuration
   [
     "items[].full_name",
     "items[].description",
     "items[].topics"
   ]
   ```

   Returnable Fields (data the AI will receive):

   ```json Returnable Fields Configuration
   [
     "items[].html_url",
     "items[].full_name",
     "items[].description"
   ]
   ```

   <Frame>
     ![Agentic RAG Configuration](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-22-48-39.png)
   </Frame>
4. Save and deploy your changes
5. Now run the repositories query again:

   ```txt Prompt
   Find cool repos related to A2A and/or MCP
   ```

<Tip>
  Notice how much cleaner and more focused the response is now\! Instead of overwhelming JSON data, you get just the meaningful content that matters to your query.
</Tip>

### Configure Agentic RAG for the other operations as well

Go through the three tabs in this section to configure the correct Searchable and Returnable fields for the agent's tools, in order to use Agentic RAG to optimize the tool calls.

    ]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Check>
  You configured Agentic RAG for four operations (Code-Snippets, Commit search, User search, Topics Search)
</Check>

### Continue from the tutorial from the WebUI

To continue testing your agent:

1. Keep the AI Workbench tab open
2. Open the web chat interface by clicking the Chat source  node (at the top of the canvas) and clicking the URL.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-07-11-14-05.png)
</Frame>

3. Select the last conversation thread you started before configuring the agentic RAG from your chat history to maintain context

<Frame>
  ![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-07-11-15-16.png)
</Frame>

Now test your agent and check the generated payload for each and the response of the Agent. Here are few Prompt optimized to ask the Agent to select specific operation. You want to see if the data returned is optimized or not. You can use the same thread or create new one.

```txt Prompt User Search
Find a few GitHub users related to MCP
```

```txt Prompt for Commit Searches
Summarize the recent commits of users related to MCP repositories
```

```txt Prompt for code Snippet search
Find the implementation of A2A and return the code snippet
```

## üìÑ Adding Code Reading Capabilities

Let's enhance our agent by adding the ability to read code directly from GitHub URLs:

1. In the left navigation menu, go to **Cloud Functions**
2. Click the **New** button
3. Replace the example code with the following snippet:

```python GitHub Code Reader Function
# === GitHub Code Reader ===
# Contract-name: xpander_run_action
# Purpose: Retrieve any file's raw text from GitHub (public or private) so downstream
#          agents can parse the code.

# import requests ‚Äì auto-imported by the runtime
import os

def xpander_run_action(repo_full_name: str, file_path: str, ref: str = "main"):
    # GitHub Code Reader
    # ------------------
    # Args:
    #     repo_full_name : str  | "owner/repo", e.g. "org/project"
    #     file_path      : str  | path within the repo, e.g. "src/app.py"
    #     ref            : str  | branch, tag, or commit SHA (default "main")
    # Optional ENV:
    #     GIT_TOKEN            | Personal Access Token for private repositories.
    #                           If present, it's sent as a Bearer token.
    # Returns:
    #     str ‚Äì the file's text on success, or an error string on failure.

    raw_url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{repo_full_name}/{ref}/{file_path}"

    headers = {}
    token = os.getenv("GIT_TOKEN")
    if token:
        headers["Authorization"] = f"Bearer {token}"

    try:
        resp = requests.get(raw_url, headers=headers, timeout=15)
        resp.raise_for_status()
    except requests.RequestException as exc:
        return f"Request failed: {exc}"

    return resp.text
```

4. Name it **GitHub Code Reader** and click **Save**
5. Return to your agent in the **Agents** section
6. Click the **\+** button
7. Select **Custom Action**
8. Add the **GitHub Code Reader** function to your agent canvas. It could take a minute for the Action to appear in the menu as it gets validated. Refresh the Agent page if you don't see it.
9. Click Deploy

Run the following prompt

```txt Example Prompt
How can I increase throughput using cross-region inference with Amazon Bedrock and boto3? Download and provide the real python code snippet from AWS repos, not a link
```

<Frame>
  ![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-04-01-29-12.png)
</Frame>

<Note>
  The screenshot is from the agent's WebUI. You can access yours by clicking the 'Chat' button on the canvas ‚Äî the WebUI URL will appear.
</Note>

## üåé Enhancing Your Agent with Web Search

Your GitHub search agent can currently only access information available on GitHub. Let's add web search capabilities to make it more versatile:

1. Return to your AI Agent workbench
2. Click the **\+** button to add components to the AI Agent
3. Select **Built-in Actions**
4. Add **Fetch Tavily AI Insights** (for comprehensive web searching)
5. Click on the gear icon in your agent canvas to edit the agent settings
6. Update your agent's instructions by adding these important rules:

   ```markdown Updated Instructions
   7. ALWAYS start with Tavily AI Insights to gather general information, but NEVER stop there
   8. After using Tavily, ALWAYS follow up with relevant GitHub searches to find concrete code examples and repositories
   9. For every user query, you must provide both web-based context AND GitHub-specific examples
   ```
7. Save & Deploy your changes
8. In the **Tester** tab, try a query that requires recent information:

   ```txt Test Prompt
   What are the latest changes to the A2A protocol specification? Show me example implementations.
   ```

Your agent should now provide more comprehensive answers by combining web search results with GitHub code examples:

<Frame>
  ![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-04-00-18-30.png)
</Frame>

<Warning>
  Sometimes, our autonomous agent might choose to use GitHub before Tavily, despite the explicit instructions that are configured in the system prompt. This happens because the AI model sees all available tools at once and makes decisions based on its understanding of the prompt and tool descriptions.

  This reveals a fascinating design challenge in AI systems: How can we create truly autonomous agents capable of making intelligent decisions while ensuring they reliably follow critical business logic when needed? ü§î

  Continue to the Dependency Graph section to find out üëâ
</Warning>

## üîÑ Creating the Agent Dependency Graph

In production, to ensure your agent follows the right search strategy, we should always create a dependency graph that deterministically enforces specific business logic behavior:

1. In your agent canvas, by attaching lines between operations, you can connect your nodes to create the dependency graph
2. Set up a workflow that requires an internet search before accessing GitHub operations:
   - Connect the Tavily AI Insights node as a prerequisite to the GitHub operations - simply drag lines from the top of all the GitHub operations to the bottom of the Tavily operation.
   - Ensure the flow follows a logical progression

<Frame>
  ![Agent Dependency Graph](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-22-42-07.png)
</Frame>

3. Repeat the query with explict request to not start with Tavily

```txt test prompt
What are the latest changes to the A2A protocol specification? Show me example implementations. Use GitHub without Tavily
```

<Note>
  You should see that the AI Agent has failed to follow the prompt, because it tried to invoke the wrong tool call against the dependency graph
  Error: The tool 'GitHubRepoDiscoveryFindRepositoriesByCriteria' was selected incorrectly and cannot be executed at this stage.
</Note>

4. Now run a prompt that does not conflict with the dependency graph:

```txt Test Prompt
Using only Google's A2A protocol implementation, create an agent that responds with 'hello world'. Provide the Python code.
```

5. Verify that the AI follows the correct workflow - first searching for information before accessing GitHub operations:

<Frame>
  ![Query Results](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-22-41-39.png)
</Frame>

<Check>
  Congratulations\! You've built a reliable AI Agent that balances autonomy with guardrails. By creating this structured workflow, you've effectively addressed both the API overflow challenge and solved the autonomous multi-step challenges
</Check>

# üåê Exposing Your Agent as an MCP server

### Step 1: Access your Agent MCP URL

The final step is to expose your optimized GitHub agent as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server:

1. In your agent canvas, click the **\+** button
2. Select **Sources** ‚Üí **MCP**
3. Click **Deploy**

<Frame>
  ![MCP Deployment](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-23-04-13.png)
</Frame>

4. After the short deployment phase completes, you'll receive a unique URL for your MCP server when you click on the MCP source node on the canvas.
5. Configure this endpoint in your Cursor IDE

Go to Cursor -\> Settings -\> MCP and click on "\+ add new global MCP Server" or edit directly the `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

<Frame>
  ![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-07-23-01-57.png)
</Frame>

```json mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers":{
    "xpander-github-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "xpander-mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-server-url/"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  Make sure to replace `https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-server-url/` with your actual MCP server URL from the deployment step\!
</Warning>

### Step 2: Customize the Cursor Settings

1. Add an explicit instruction to prioritize MCP commands in the "system prompt" configuration of your Cursor IDE.

```txt Rules
If relevant to the question, always use MCP tools when available before answering
```

<Frame>
  ![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-05-15-52-08.png)
</Frame>

2. Make sure the MCP server is active (Cursor Settings -\> MCP)

<Frame>
  ![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-05-15-54-23.png)
</Frame>

3. Restart Cursor IDE to apply the changes

### Step 3: Ask Cursor Agent to invoke MCP

Test your MCP integration by providing this prompt in the Cursor AI Agent section:

```txt Prompt to Agent (via MCP)
search for code samples of xpander-ai sdk
```

<Tip>
  If you don't want to manually approve each MCP tool call, you can go to cursor settings and enable auto-run mode -- "Allow Agent to run tools without asking for confirmation, such as executing commands and writing to files"
</Tip>
