<Note>
  **Tutorial Summary**

  - **Goal**: Build a Smart Support Agent that answers docs questions, creates Notion tickets, and schedules Calendly calls
  - **Estimated Time**: 20‚Äì30 minutes
  - **Prerequisites**: Xpander.ai account, Mintlify documentation, Notion workspace, Calendly account, OpenAI API key
</Note>

When a developer asks a technical question regarding integration workflows, traditional support systems often fall short. They either provide generic responses or require human agents to handle every query, creating bottlenecks and delays.

Frameworks like **Agno** have made building AI agent prototypes more accessible than ever. However, the true engineering challenge lies in building completely autonomous AI agents that can orchestrate complex workflows and move beyond simple Q&A bots.

**[Xpander.ai](http://xpander.ai)** addresses this challenge, enabling engineering teams to leap from prototype to production-grade autonomous agents with enterprise-ready infrastructure.

## üó∫Ô∏è What We're Building: Automated Docs Helpdesk

</Frame>

Ever feel stuck answering the same customer questions again and again? No matter how good your documentation is, customers can't find the right answers to their queries. This leads to repetitive support tickets, increased workload on human agents, and slow response times.

Imagine your documentation being part of your support team. With **Xpander.ai**, we can create an AI agent that lives inside the documentation itself‚Äîcapable of answering queries accurately and with speed. When unable to find answers, it escalates tickets to Notion for human intervention and provides options to schedule calls via Calendly.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Smart Documentation Search
- **Answer First** ‚Äì Agent's primary goal is to find answers directly within the documentation
- **Confidence-based responses** ‚Äì Only provides answers when confidence ‚â• 0.85
- **Source citation** ‚Äì Always includes documentation URLs for transparency

### 2. Intelligent Escalation
- **Smart ticket creation** ‚Äì Creates Notion tickets when unable to find relevant answers
- **No guesswork** ‚Äì Never provides uncertain responses
- **Human handoff** ‚Äì Seamless transition to human support when needed

### 3. Proactive Scheduling
- **Calendly integration** ‚Äì Offers call scheduling after handling tickets
- **Flexible booking** ‚Äì Users can schedule calls regardless of ticket status
- **Multi-modal support** ‚Äì Combines chat, tickets, and calls for comprehensive support

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Xpander.ai account** ‚Äì For agent orchestration and deployment
2. **Mintlify documentation** ‚Äì Source of truth for agent responses  
3. **Notion workspace** ‚Äì For ticket management and escalation
4. **Calendly account** ‚Äì For call scheduling integration
5. **OpenAI API key** ‚Äì For LLM inference (GPT-4o-mini recommended)

<Tip>
  The entire project is available on **Xpander.ai** platform as a **pre-built template**. With just a few clicks, you can deploy your version. This template is already in use within the Xpander.ai community.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Setting Up the Agent

Access the Xpander platform at `https://app.xpander.ai/` and click "New Agent" at the top right of the workspace.

<Frame>
  ![Agent Creation](/images/tutorial-3/image.png)
</Frame>

**Configuration:**
- **Agent Name**: Mintlify Docs Support Agent
- **Framework**: Agno (currently the only framework available on Xpander.ai)
- **LLM Selection**: GPT-4o-mini (recommended for speed and efficiency)
- **Knowledge Base**: Connect your Mintlify documentation files for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

<Frame>

### Step 2: Writing the System Prompt

The system prompt is critical as it determines the core instructions for the agent. Xpander.ai provides an in-built AI to help generate effective prompts.

**Our Approach:**

**Mission Statement:**
```
You are the Mintlify agent for xpander.ai. Serve as the primary support channel using only Mintlify docs, OR if confidence is below 0.85, start the fallback process.
```

**Behavior Workflow:**
1. **High Confidence (‚â• 0.85)**: Paraphrase the answer concisely and cite the source URL
2. **Low Confidence (< 0.85)**: Start the fallback process (no guessing allowed)

<Frame>
  ![Smart Support Agent Architecture](/images/tutorial-3/mintlify-seq.drawio.png)
</Frame>

**Fallback Process:**
- Offer to create a support ticket through **Notion**
- After ticket creation or user preference, provide **Calendly** scheduling option

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Step 3: Multi-Agent Coordination

Xpander.ai makes third-party tool integration completely hassle-free through ready-to-use connectors.

**Configuring Mintlify Search Tool:**

In the tools tab, configure the Mintlify Search tool with additional instructions for effective documentation querying.

<Frame>
  ![Mintlify Tool Configuration](/images/tutorial-3/image%203.png)
</Frame>

**Attaching Third-Party Agents:**

Navigate to the Connectors menu and find connectors for Notion and Calendly. Each connector provides ready-made API endpoints for specific actions:

- **Notion**: API endpoint for creating support tickets
- **Calendly**: API endpoint for scheduling calls

<Frame>

</Frame>

In the Multi-agent tab, attach the third-party agents (Xpander-Notion and Calendly) found in the connectors menu.

### Step 4: Setting Rules and Goals

Encode the most important instructions as Rules and Goals for consistent behavior.

**Key Rule**: 
```
Always answer user queries solely using xpander.ai's Mintlify-indexed documentation, querying llms.txt and llms-full.txt first.
```

**Key Goal**: 
```
When documentation lacks confident answers, offer to create a Notion support ticket with relevant user query details for further assistance.
```

## üß™ Agent in Action

### Scenario 1: Answer Not Found (Escalation Flow)

**User Query:**
```
Hi I need help configuring agent with Agno, is your team available tomorrow morning for a tech session @AI Support engineer
```

**Agent Response Flow:**

1. **Initial Assessment**: Agent searches documentation but finds no confident answer
2. **Escalation Offer**: "I couldn't locate a relevant entry in our documentation for that specific integration. Would you like to open a support ticket in Notion so our team can assist further?"
3. **Ticket Creation**: Creates support ticket #12345 in Notion
4. **Follow-up**: "Great, I've created a support ticket #12345 for you. Our team will be in touch shortly. Would you also like to schedule a call with our support team to discuss this issue?"

**Results:**

- **Notion Ticket Created**:

</Frame>

### Scenario 2: Answer Found (Direct Response)

When the agent finds a high-confidence answer, the interaction is quick and efficient. It provides a direct response along with the source URL from the documentation.
