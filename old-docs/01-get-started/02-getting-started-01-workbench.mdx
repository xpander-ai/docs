## What you will achieve in this quickstart guide:
1. Prototype an AI Agent in the Workbench by adding tools and instructions.
2. Use the visual tester to test the behavior and tool calling.
3. Chat to the AI Agent from an external source (fully hosted Chainlit).

## Using the AI Agent Workbench

<Steps>

<Step title="Log in to the xpander.ai platform.">

</Frame>
The workbench is split to two parts:

ðŸ’»Agent configuration - add tools, memory and storage, agent triggering, multi-agent configuration, add your agent instructions and rules, and more.

ðŸ¤–Agent preview - chat to your agent or view the "Agent graph" which shows your API dependency, multi-agent connectivity, and a real-time reaction of your agent when prompted through the Agent preview chat.

</Step>


<Step title="Build a new AI agent">
1. In the Agent configuration panel, give your agent a name.
2. In the Tools tab, click the `+ Add tools` button, and in the right panel add these following tools:
   - Google News â†’ Retrieve News Articles By Topic  
   - Built-in actions â†’ Send Email
</Step>

<Step title="Add AI-assisted instructions and rules">
1. In the Instructions tab, click "Write instructions with AI"
2. Enter the following: `AI Agent that can get the latest news about any topic from the Google News tool, and then send those news in a nicely parsed way via the Send Email tool`
3. You will see the System prompt, Rules and Goals automatically get populated with agent-optimized prompts.
4. Deploy your agent by clicking the `Deploy` button on the top right.

</Step>


<Step title="Test your agent">
1. In the top right workbench tabs, switch to `Full view` - now you see the configuration panel, Tester (Chat) panel, and the Agent graph on the right.
2. In the Tester (chat) panel, enter the following prompt: `Get the latest news about LLM reasoning models, and send them to me over email`
3. Check the tool selection process in the graph indicated by the moving Purple dot. This gets more useful as you add more tools and connected agents.
4. Check the request/response process and payloads in the tester panel.
