# Getting started

  <Tab title="For Developers">
    Build AI agents faster by focusing exclusively on agent logic rather than infrastructure
    
    ```python Simple Agent Usage
    from xpander_sdk import Agents
    
    # Initialize agent backend
    agents = Agents()
    agent_backend = agents.get(agent_id=os.getenv("XPANDER_AGENT_ID"))
    
    # Create and execute a task
    task = agent_backend.create_task(
        prompt="Analyze this data and provide insights"
    )
    
    # Get results
    print(f"Task Status: {task.status}")
    print(f"Task Result: {task.result}")
    
    # Or monitor with event streaming
    for event in task.events():
        if event.type == "task_finished":
            print("Task completed!")
            break
    ```
