## Quick Start: Add a Backend to Your Agent

<Note>
This guide provides a simple Hello World example to get you started with xpander's backend services.

**You'll learn:**
- How to connect to xpander's backend services
- Basic agent execution flow
- How to process tool calls
- How to manage conversation state
- Core SDK architecture and components
</Note>

This guide shows how to enhance any agent with xpander.ai's backend for memory, tools, and more.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
# Python
pip install xpander-sdk

# Node.js
npm install @xpander-ai/sdk

# CLI (for agent creation)
npm install -g xpander-cli
```

### Use xpander-cli to scaffold a new agent template

```bash
xpander login
xpander agent new
python xpander_handler.py  # Entry point for your agent's event handling
```

### Create Hello World Agent

```python hello_world_agent.py
# First, install the SDK if you haven't already
# pip install xpander-sdk

from xpander_sdk import Agents
import os

# Initialize the Agents module (backend-as-a-service)
# Set these environment variables before running:
# XPANDER_API_KEY and XPANDER_ORGANIZATION_ID
agents = Agents()

# Get your agent backend from xpander.ai
# Create your agent first at https://app.xpander.ai
agent_backend = agents.get(agent_id=os.getenv("XPANDER_AGENT_ID"))

# Create and execute a task
task = agent_backend.create_task(
    prompt="Hello world! Tell me what you can do."
)

# Check task status and result
print(f"Task Status: {task.status}")
print(f"Task Result: {task.result}")

# Or stream events for real-time monitoring
for event in task.events():
    print(f"Event: {event.type}")
    if event.type == "task_finished":
        print("Task completed!")
        break
print(f"Thread ID: {thread_id}")
```


### Deploy agent to the cloud

```bash
xpander deploy  # Deploys the Docker container to the cloud and runs it via xpander_handler.py
xpander logs    # Streams logs locally from your configured agent
```


## What This Does

The example above:

1. Connects to xpander.ai's backend services
2. Loads an agent you've created in the [Builder](https://app.xpander.ai)
3. Adds a task for the agent to process
4. Runs the agent with the OpenAI API
5. Executes any tools the agent needs
6. Returns the result with a thread ID for continuity

See the full Hello World application [here](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander.ai/tree/main/Getting-Started/hello-worlds).

## How the Backend Works

The xpander.ai backend handles LLM calls, tool execution, and memory management automatically. You simply:

1. **Create tasks** with simple prompts
2. **Get results** immediately via task properties 
3. **Monitor progress** with event streaming if needed
4. **Manage agents** through the console at https://app.xpander.ai

The backend automatically handles:
- LLM provider selection and API calls
- Tool execution and validation  
- Memory management and context
- Error handling and retries
