## Enforcing Agent Transitions Without Manager
For advanced use cases, you can enforce transitions between agents in a sequence even when the first agent believes it has completed its task - all without requiring a Manager Agent.

## Key Use Cases
This powerful capability is particularly useful when:
- You need deterministic transitions at specific points in your workflow
- A first agent might incorrectly consider its task complete before all required steps are done
- You want to implement custom business logic for determining when to transition
- You need to split complex tasks across specialized agents with precise control

## Implementation Steps

## Example Workflow

Here's an example workflow that demonstrates how to enforce transitions between agents in a sequence:

The diagram illustrates a powerful automatic workflow transition:

1. **Initial Processing Agent** - This first agent processes the user's query and completes its designated task.

2. **Slack Messaging Agent** - Even though the user didn't explicitly request to send anything to Slack, the AI State Machine automatically invokes this agent after the first agent completes its work.
