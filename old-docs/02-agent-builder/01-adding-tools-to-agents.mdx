## What are Agent Tools?

Tools in xpander.ai are operations provided by interfaces (LinkedIn, Reddit, Weather, etc.) that allow agents to interact with external systems and data sources. Tools enable your agent to interact with the real world - accessing databases, calling APIs, controlling external services, and even delegating to other agents.

## Basic Tool Usage

```python basic-tool-usage.py
from xpander_sdk import Agents

# Initialize agent backend with tools configured
agents = Agents()
agent_backend = agents.get(agent_id="your-agent-id")

# Create a task - tools are executed automatically by the backend
task = agent_backend.create_task(
    prompt="Search for recent articles about artificial intelligence"
)

# Results include any tool executions that occurred
print(f"Task Status: {task.status}")
print(f"Task Result: {task.result}")
```
```

<Tip>
If you want to control how your agent uses these tools in a hierarchical structure, check out the [Agent Graph System](/docs/02-agent-builder/02-agent-graph-system) guide.
</Tip>

## Visual Tool Management

The Agent Builder provides a visual interface for managing tools:

1. Create an agent in the Builder at https://app.xpander.ai
2. Use the canvas to add tools visually
3. Configure tools with a user-friendly interface
4. Test tools directly in the platform

- Any API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication & API Management">
xpander.ai provides a comprehensive authentication layer that simplifies connecting to various services:

- **Managed Authentication**: Many interfaces (marked "xpander built-in auth") come with pre-configured authentication, allowing immediate use without setup
- **Custom Authentication**: For services requiring your credentials, xpander.ai offers a streamlined authentication flow
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Support for OAuth2, API keys, and other authentication protocols
- **Granular Scope Control**: Configure exactly what permissions your agent needs for each service
- **Secure Credential Storage**: All authentication details are securely stored and managed

<Frame>
![Authentication Configuration](/static/images/screenshots/2025-03-15-23-13-28.png)
</Frame>

Beyond authentication, xpander.ai includes a full API management portal that helps you:

- Browse available operations grouped by functionality
- View detailed API documentation for each endpoint
- Configure operation-specific parameters
- Monitor API usage and rate limits
- Test endpoints directly from the interface

This comprehensive API management layer eliminates the need to build and maintain your own API integrations, saving significant development time.

## Defining and Using Local Tools

Local tools require manual implementation by defining both their schema and function:

```python local_tools.py
def read_file(file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Your implementation here
    return {"success": True, "content": "File content here"}

# Then define the tool declarations (schema for the LLM)
local_tools = [
    {
        "declaration": {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "read_file",
                "description": "Read a file from the sandbox",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "file_path": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "Path to the file to read"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["file_path"]
                }
            }
        },
        "fn": read_file
    }
]

# Create convenient lookup structures
local_tools_list = [tool['declaration'] for tool in local_tools]
local_tools_by_name = {tool['declaration']['function']['name']: tool['fn'] for tool in local_tools}

# Local tools are managed through the console
# Go to https://app.xpander.ai to configure custom tools
```

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Tool Selection Tips">
- **Be selective**: Only add tools your agent needs for its specific task
- **Understand parameters**: Review what each operation requires
- **Test individually**: Verify each operation works before combining them
- **Group logically**: Organize related operations from the same interface
- **Document choices**: Track which operations you've added and why
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting Tool Access

When working with tools, you might encounter various issues that prevent your agent from accessing or properly using them. Here are common problems and their solutions:

<Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
- **Invalid Signature Error**: 
  ```json
  {"error": 401, "detail": {"detail": "error(401): {\"message\":\"invalid signature\"}"}
  ```
  **Solution**: Check your API key validity and ensure it hasn't expired. Regenerate your API key in the interface settings if needed.

- **Missing Credentials**: 
  ```
  Unable to list projects due to an authentication error (invalid signature). Please check your credentials and try again.
  ```
  **Solution**: Verify that you've correctly configured the authentication for the interface. For interfaces requiring OAuth, ensure you've completed the authorization flow.

- **Token Expired**:
  **Solution**: Re-authenticate the interface by going to Interface Settings and clicking "Reconnect" for the specific interface.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Debugging Tips">
- Use the Activity View to inspect the full request and response for each tool call
- Test operations directly from the interface page before attaching them to agents
- For SDK usage, implement detailed logging to capture all interactions:
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
  ```
- Check interface connection status regularly in the dashboard
- For custom interfaces, validate your OpenAPI specification with a tool like Swagger Editor
