## Overview

Agent templates enable you to export AI agents into reusable, shareable configurations that can be imported across different organizations. This powerful feature facilitates:

- **Cross-Account Sharing**: Share agent configurations between organizations
- **Agent Marketplace**: Distribute pre-built agents as templates
- **Backup & Migration**: Create portable copies of your agents
- **Version Control**: Maintain templates for different agent configurations

## Agent Templates

An agent template packages all components of an AI agent into a portable format:

- **Agent Configuration**: Instructions, settings, and behavior
- **Tools & Integrations**: Connected tools and custom functions
- **Sub-Agents**: Complete hierarchy of delegated agents
- **Knowledge Bases** (Optional): Associated documents and files

<Note>
Templates support **cross-account usage**, meaning an agent exported from one organization can be imported into any other organization.
</Note>

## Exporting Agents

Export an agent to create a reusable template that can be shared or imported later.

### Export Options

When exporting an agent, you can control whether to include knowledge bases:

<ParamField path="with_knowledge_bases" type="boolean" default={true}>
  Controls whether knowledge bases and their document files are included in the export
  - `true`: Includes all knowledge bases with their documents and files
  - `false`: Exports only agent configuration without knowledge bases
</ParamField>

### REST API Example

#### Export with Knowledge Bases

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.xpander.ai/v1/agents/{agent_id}/export \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Customer Support Agent Template",
    "description": "Pre-configured agent for customer support workflows",
    "icon": "🎧",
    "with_knowledge_bases": true
  }'
```

#### Export without Knowledge Bases

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.xpander.ai/v1/agents/{agent_id}/export \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Support Agent Config Only",
    "description": "Agent configuration without knowledge bases",
    "icon": "🎧",
    "with_knowledge_bases": false
  }'
```

### Response Structure

The export returns an `AgentTemplate` object containing:

```json
{
  "id": "template-123",
  "name": "Customer Support Agent Template",
  "description": "Pre-configured agent for customer support workflows",
  "icon": "🎧",
  "organization_id": "org-456",
  "agent_definition": {
    "id": "agent-789",
    "name": "Support Agent",
    "description": "Handles customer inquiries",
    "instructions": {
      "role": ["Customer support specialist"],
      "goal": ["Resolve customer issues efficiently"],
      "general": "Be helpful and professional"
    },
    "custom_functions": [...],
    "connectors": [...],
    "sub_agents": [...],
    "knowledge_bases": [
      {
        "name": "Product Documentation",
        "description": "Product guides and FAQs",
        "documents": [
          {
            "name": "User Guide",
            "url": "https://...",
            "content": "..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Importing Agents

Import a template to create a new agent instance in your organization.

### REST API Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.xpander.ai/v1/agents/template_import/{template_id} \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Support Agent",
    "description": "Customized support agent from template",
    "icon": "🎧",
    "with_knowledge_bases": true
  }'
```

### Import Behavior

When importing a template:

1. **New Agent Created**: A fresh agent instance is created in your organization
2. **Configuration Copied**: All agent settings, instructions, and tools are replicated
3. **Sub-Agents Recreated**: Complete agent hierarchy is maintained
4. **Knowledge Bases** (if included): Documents are copied to your organization
5. **Tools & Connectors**: Tool configurations are preserved (you may need to provide credentials)

<Note>
The imported agent is fully independent from the original. Changes to the imported agent won't affect the source agent or template.
</Note>

## Cross-Account Sharing

Templates can be shared and used across different organizations, enabling powerful collaboration scenarios.

### Sharing Workflow

1. **Organization A** exports an agent as a template
2. Template ID is shared with **Organization B** (via documentation, marketplace, etc.)
3. **Organization B** imports the template using the template ID
4. A new agent instance is created in **Organization B**

## Knowledge Base Handling

### Including Knowledge Bases

When `with_knowledge_bases: true`:
- **Documents**: All document files are exported with their content
- **Structure**: Knowledge base organization is preserved
- **Size**: Export may be larger due to document content

### Excluding Knowledge Bases

When `with_knowledge_bases: false`:
- **Lightweight**: Smaller export size for faster sharing
- **Configuration Only**: Agent behavior without data
- **Flexibility**: Import and attach different knowledge bases later

<Tip>
Use `with_knowledge_bases: false` when sharing agent logic that should use organization-specific knowledge, or when document files are too large for convenient sharing.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### For Exporting

1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive template names
2. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive descriptions
3. **Knowledge Base Decision**: Choose whether to include based on use case:
   - Include for complete, ready-to-use agents
   - Exclude for configurable frameworks
4. **Icon Selection**: Use meaningful icons for easy identification

### For Importing

1. **Review Template**: Understand what's included before importing
2. **Customize After Import**: Adjust agent settings for your needs
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate imported agents in your environment
4. **Tool Credentials**: Ensure you have access to required integrations
5. **Knowledge Base Validation**: Verify imported documents are appropriate

### For Cross-Account Sharing

1. **Security Review**: Ensure no sensitive data in templates
2. **Documentation**: Provide clear usage instructions
3. **Version Management**: Track template versions for updates
4. **Access Control**: Share template IDs securely

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
When creating templates for cross-account sharing, ensure:
- No API keys or credentials in agent configurations
- No sensitive business data in knowledge bases
- No organization-specific identifiers
- Compliance with data sharing policies
</Warning>

### What Gets Shared

**Included in Templates:**
- Agent instructions and behavior
- Tool configurations (without credentials)
- Knowledge base documents (if selected)
- Sub-agent hierarchies

**NOT Included:**
- API keys or secrets
- Organization-specific credentials
- User data or execution history
- Account identifiers

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Sharing Agent Logic Only

```bash
# Export without knowledge bases
POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/export
{
  "name": "Sales Assistant Framework",
  "with_knowledge_bases": false
}

# Recipient imports and adds their own knowledge
POST /v1/agents/template_import/{template_id}
# Then attach organization-specific knowledge bases
```

### Scenario 2: Complete Agent Package

```bash
# Export with everything
POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/export
{
  "name": "Complete Onboarding Agent",
  "with_knowledge_bases": true
}

# Recipient gets fully functional agent
POST /v1/agents/template_import/{template_id}
```

### Scenario 3: Agent Marketplace Distribution

```bash
# Create marketplace-ready template
POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/export
{
  "name": "E-commerce Support Agent",
  "description": "Ready-to-use agent for online stores",
  "icon": "🛒",
  "with_knowledge_bases": true
}

# Multiple organizations can import
POST /v1/agents/template_import/marketplace-template-123
```
