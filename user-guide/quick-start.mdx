<Steps>
  <Step title="Start from a new or existing agent">
    Use the Workbench at [app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai) to set up your agent's framework (runtime environment), instructions, model, tools, and knowledge bases through the intuitive web interface.

    You can also start from a [template](/Examples/templates/01-index).

  <Tip>
  You can also start from the CLI and skip the UI, by running `xpander agent new` and following the wizard. Install the xpander CLI by running `npm install -g xpander-cli`
</Tip>

    </Frame>


  </Step>

  <Step title="Download and customize your agent code">
   The `init` command is used to download the entire agent code to your local machine, pre-scaffolded with the desired framework (runtime environment - i.e. Agno), as well as the configuration of the agent.

   <Note>
   You can use the agent ID, agent name, or run without specifying an agent to get an interactive selection list.
   </Note>

    ```bash
    # Install the xpander CLI
    npm install -g xpander-cli

    # Initialize your agent project (choose one):
    xpander agent init                    # Option 1: Interactive selection list
    # OR
    xpander agent init "my-agent"         # Option 2: Use agent name
    # OR  
    xpander agent init "abc123"           # Option 3: Use agent ID
    # OR
    x a i                                 # Option 4: Shortcut with selection list
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your business logic">
  By editing your agent's code, you can add your own business logic, workflows and functions, or external API calls - giving you full control over how your agent behaves.
<Note>
  The `@on_task` decorator registers your function as an event handler that processes incoming tasks from Slack, WebUI, or webhooks. 

  The `@register_tool` decorator makes your custom functions available to the AI agent, allowing it to call your business logic when needed. 
  
     Read more about these decorators in the [Events](/API%20reference/events/index) and [Tools](/API%20reference/tools/index) sections of the API Reference.
  </Note>
    ```python Agent Code
    from xpander_sdk import Backend, on_task, Task, register_tool
    from agno.agent import Agent

    @register_tool  # Register local tools
    def weather_check(location: str) -> str:
        """Check weather for a location"""
        return f"Weather in {location}: Sunny, 25¬∞C"

    @on_task
    def handle_request(task: Task):
        backend = Backend(task.configuration)
        agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())  # Gets remote tools + your local tools
        
        result = agent.arun(message=task.to_message())
        task.result = result.content
        return task
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test locally">
    Test your agent in real-time by running it locally. The development server connects to your xpander backend and routes all incoming requests (Slack, WebUI, webhooks) to your local machine for instant feedback and debugging.

    ```bash Local Development
    # Start local development server
    xpander dev
    
    # Or run with debug logging
    xpander dev --debug
    ```

    ```text Development Output
    DEBUG    | Events initialised 
    INFO     | Listener started; waiting for events‚Ä¶
    INFO     | Agent 'Support AI Engineer' chat: https://amaranth-mammal.agents.xpander.ai | builder: https://app.xpander.ai/agents/4b4cf37c-53ae-4280-8b96-844ed13bea6c
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to your environment">
    ```bash Deployment
    # Deploy the agent to the xpander cloud
    xpander deploy
    ```

    Your agent is now live with automatic scaling, monitoring, and all human interfaces (Slack, WebUI, webhooks) configured!
  </Step>

## CLI Command Reference

The xpander.ai CLI supports both full commands and shortcuts for faster usage:

### üéõÔ∏è Control Plane Commands
Manage agents in xpander.ai's cloud platform:

```bash
xpander login               # Authenticate with xpander.ai (opens browser)
x l                         # ‚Üë shortcut

xpander agent new           # Create new agent interactively  
x a n                       # ‚Üë shortcut
x a n --name "bot" --folder "." --framework "agno"  # Non-interactive

xpander agent edit [agent]  # Edit agent configuration (browser)
x a e [agent]               # ‚Üë shortcut

xpander agent delete [agent] # Delete agent permanently
x a del [agent]             # ‚Üë shortcut

xpander agent invoke [agent] "message" # Test agent via webhook
x a invoke [agent] "message" # ‚Üë shortcut
```

### üèóÔ∏è Local Development Commands  
Download framework templates and test locally:

```bash
xpander agent init [agent]  # Download agent files to current folder
x a i [agent]               # ‚Üë shortcut

xpander agent dev [agent]   # Run agent locally for testing
x a dev [agent]             # ‚Üë shortcut
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment Commands
Deploy containers and monitor in the cloud:

```bash
xpander agent deploy [agent] # Deploy agent as Docker container
x a d [agent]               # ‚Üë shortcut

xpander agent logs [agent]  # Stream real-time logs from cloud
x a l [agent]               # ‚Üë shortcut

xpander agent restart [agent] # Restart deployed container
x a restart [agent]         # ‚Üë shortcut

xpander agent stop [agent]  # Stop running container
x a stop [agent]            # ‚Üë shortcut
```

<Tip>
Commands with `[agent]` show a selection list if no agent is specified. Agent lists are sorted by creation date (newest first).
</Tip>
