<Steps>
  <Step title="Start from a new or existing agent">
    Use the Workbench at [app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai) to set up your agent's framework (runtime environment), instructions, model, tools, and knowledge bases through the intuitive web interface.

    You can also start from a [template](/Examples/templates/01-index).

  <Tip>
  You can also start from the CLI and skip the UI, by running `xpander agent new` and following the wizard. Install the xpander CLI by running `npm install -g xpander-cli`

  </Step>

  <Step title="Download and customize your agent code">
   The `init` command is used to download the entire agent code to your local machine, pre-scaffolded with the desired framework (runtime environment - i.e. Agno), as well as the configuration of the agent.

    ```bash
    # Install the xpander CLI
    npm install -g xpander-cli

    # Initialize your agent project
    xpander agent init "your-agent-id"
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your business logic">
  By editing your agent's code, you can add your own business logic, tools, workflows, or external API calls - giving you full control over how your agent behaves.

  The `@on_task` decorator registers your function as an event handler that processes incoming tasks from Slack, WebUI, or webhooks. 

  The `@register_tool` decorator makes your custom functions available to the AI agent, allowing it to call your business logic when needed. 
  
     Read more about these decorators in the [Events](/API%20reference/events) and [Tools](/API%20reference/tools) sections of the API Reference.
  
    ```python Agent Code
    from xpander_sdk import Backend, on_task, Task, register_tool
    from agno.agent import Agent

    @register_tool  # Register local tools
    def weather_check(location: str) -> str:
        """Check weather for a location"""
        return f"Weather in {location}: Sunny, 25°C"

    @on_task
    def handle_request(task: Task):
        backend = Backend(task.configuration)
        agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())  # Gets remote tools + your local tools
        
        result = agent.arun(message=task.to_message())
        task.result = result.content
        return task
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test locally">
    ```bash Local Development
    # Run agent locally for development
    xpander dev
    ```

    ```text Development Output
    DEBUG    | Events initialised 
    INFO     | Listener started; waiting for events…
    INFO     | Agent 'Support AI Engineer' chat: https://amaranth-mammal.agents.xpander.ai | builder: https://app.xpander.ai/agents/4b4cf37c-53ae-4280-8b96-844ed13bea6c
    ```

    Events from WebUI and Slack are now routed to your local machine for real-time development and testing!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to your environment">
    ```bash Deployment
    # Deploy the agent to the xpander cloud
    xpander deploy
    ```

    Your agent is now live with automatic scaling, monitoring, and all human interfaces (Slack, WebUI, webhooks) configured!
  </Step>
