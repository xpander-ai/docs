Serverless is the default deployment mode when you build agents entirely in the **Workbench** without customizing code. Your agent runs on agent-workers (xpander cloud or self-hosted) without you managing containers or code files.

<Note>
**When you customize agent code** (write your own `xpander_handler.py`), your agent automatically becomes containerized when you run `xpander deploy`. See [Agent Containers](/user-guide/run/agent-containers) for the code-first workflow.
</Note>

## How It Works

Build your agent visually in Workbench:

1. **Configure in UI**: Set LLM model, system prompt, tools, knowledge bases
2. **Click Deploy**: Agent runs on serverless agent-workers
3. **Invoke**: Use REST API, SDK, Slack, webhooks, or any integration

**No code required.** The platform handles everything.

**Agent-worker architecture:**

- **xpander Cloud**: Managed agent-workers that auto-scale
- **Self-Hosted**: Deploy agent-workers to your own Kubernetes cluster

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build Agent in Workbench">
    Configure your agent using the visual interface:

    - **LLM Settings**: Choose model (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, etc.)
    - **Instructions**: Define agent role, goals, and behavior
    - **Connectors**: Add tools (Slack, GitHub, Google, etc.)
    - **Knowledge Bases**: Upload documents for RAG
    - **Memory**: Enable user memories and session storage
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy from Workbench">
    Click **Deploy** in Workbench.

    Your agent automatically runs on serverless agent-workers.

    No Dockerfile, no CLI commands, no code files needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Invoke from Anywhere">
    Call your agent via REST API, SDK, Slack, webhooks, or any integration:

    ```python
    from xpander_sdk import Backend, Configuration

    backend = Backend(configuration=Configuration(api_key="<your-key>"))

    result = backend.invoke_agent(
        agent_id="<agent-id>",
        input="Your message",
        user_id="user@example.com",
        session_id="session-123"
    )
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Serverless vs Containers

| Feature | Serverless (No Code) | Containers (Code-First) |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| **How you build** | Workbench UI only | Write `xpander_handler.py` code |
| **Deployment** | Click Deploy in Workbench | Run `xpander deploy` CLI |
| **Infrastructure** | Agent-workers (managed or self-hosted) | Docker containers + registry |
| **Complexity** | Zero code, zero configuration | Write code, manage Dockerfile |
| **Flexibility** | Pre-configured runtime | Full control over environment |
| **Use case** | Most agents | Custom dependencies, advanced logic |

## Where Agent-Workers Run

### xpander Cloud (Default)

Your agent runs on xpander's managed agent-workers:

- Automatic scaling
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- No infrastructure to manage
- Data processed in xpander cloud

### Self-Hosted

Deploy agent-workers to your own Kubernetes:

- Full data control
- Runs in your infrastructure
- Deploy once, use for all serverless agents
- See [Self-Hosted Deployment](/user-guide/run/self-hosted-deployment)

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set environment variables in Workbench **Settings** → **Environment Variables**:

```bash
# Custom configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
API_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com
```

### Resource Limits

Configure in Workbench **Settings** → **Resources**:

- **CPU**: 0.25 - 4 vCPUs
- **Memory**: 512MB - 8GB
- **Timeout**: 30s - 15min

---

## Monitoring

View execution metrics in **Monitor** tab:

- Request count and latency
- Memory and CPU usage
- Error rates
- Token usage
- Thread history and logs

See [Observability](/user-guide/manage/observability) for detailed monitoring.

## When to Use

**Use Serverless (no code) when:**

- ✅ Building agents with Workbench UI
- ✅ Don't need custom code logic
- ✅ Standard connectors and tools are sufficient
- ✅ Want zero infrastructure management

**Use Containers (code-first) when:**

- ❌ Need to write custom agent logic
- ❌ Require custom system dependencies
- ❌ Need specific Python packages or base images
- ❌ Want full control over agent behavior

<Note>
**Taking over agent code?** Once you customize the agent code with `xpander agent new`, your agent automatically becomes containerized when you run `xpander deploy`. See [Agent Containers](/user-guide/run/agent-containers).
