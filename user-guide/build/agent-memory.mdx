Configure your agent's memory settings in the Workbench to control how it stores and recalls information.

## Memory Types

Each agent includes a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage. Configure which memory types your agent supports using the toggles in the Workbench UI:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Session Storage" icon="database">
    Automatic conversation history and state persistence (always enabled)
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Memories" icon="user">
    Long-term facts and preferences about users ("ChatGPT-style" memory)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Memories" icon="robot">
    Agent-specific memory storage for persistent agent state
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agentic Memory" icon="sparkles">
    Advanced memory capabilities with contextual understanding
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agentic Culture" icon="users-gear">
    Cultural context and team dynamics for multi-agent systems
  </Card>
  <Card title="Session Summaries" icon="message">
    Automatically summarizes long conversations for future reference
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For advanced use cases, the storage is accessible programmatically via `agno_agent.get_db()`.

## Memory Features Explained

### Session Storage
Automatically enabled for all agents. Stores conversation history and maintains context across messages within a session.

### User Memories
Long-term memory about individual users that persists across sessions. Similar to ChatGPT's memory feature, the agent remembers facts, preferences, and context about each user.

### Agent Memories
Persistent storage specific to the agent itself. Useful for maintaining agent state, learned patterns, or configuration that should persist across all conversations.

### Agentic Memory
Advanced memory capabilities that enable contextual understanding and intelligent recall. The agent can reason about what information is relevant and when to recall it.

### Agentic Culture
Enables cultural context for multi-agent systems. Agents can share knowledge, maintain team dynamics, and coordinate based on shared understanding.

### Session Summaries
Automatically generates summaries of long conversations to maintain context efficiently without using excessive tokens.

## Using Memory in Your Code

The memory configuration from the Workbench UI is automatically applied to your agent. Use the `user_id` parameter to access user-specific memories and conversation history:

```python
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())  # Memory settings applied from UI
agno_agent.print_response(message="What did we talk about yesterday?", user_id="user123")
```
