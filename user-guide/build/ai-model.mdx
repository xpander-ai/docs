xpander provides flexible AI model configuration, allowing you to use xpander's managed models or bring your own LLM keys and AI Gateway.

## Using the Workbench

Configure your AI model from the Workbench **General** → **LLM Settings** panel.

### Bring Your Own Keys

You can bring your own LLM API keys and use your own AI Gateway through the configuration panel.

</Frame>

**Configuration options:**
- **Model Provider** - Select from supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, AWS Bedrock, etc.)
- **API Key** - Your provider's API key for authentication
- **API Base URL** - Custom AI Gateway endpoint (e.g., `ai.your-company.com`)
- **Model Name** - Specific model version to use

<Note>
If your AI Gateway is behind a private subnet or firewall, make sure to run xpander in the same network with access to those models.
</Note>

## Using the SDK

When running agents with the SDK, the `Backend` object automatically includes the LLM client configured in the Workbench, with API keys securely managed in the platform vault.

<Info>
**No model configuration needed!** The agent uses the Workbench LLM settings by default. Only override the model if you need to change it at runtime.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>

```python Default (Uses Workbench Config)
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())

# Agent uses the model configured in Workbench
agno_agent.print_response(input='What is xpander?')
```

```python Override with OpenAI (Optional)
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAI

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())

# Override to use a specific OpenAI model
agno_agent.model = OpenAI('gpt-4o')

agno_agent.print_response(input='Explain quantum computing')
```

```python Override with Anthropic (Optional)
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Anthropic

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())

# Override to use Claude
agno_agent.model = Anthropic('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')

agno_agent.print_response(input='Write a haiku about AI')
```

```python Override with Ollama (Optional)
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.ollama import Ollama

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())

# Override to use self-hosted model
agno_agent.model = Ollama('llama3:8b')

agno_agent.print_response(input="What's your role?")
```

</CodeGroup>

### How Backend Configuration Works

By default, the `Backend` object automatically fetches the LLM configuration from the Workbench:
- **Model Provider** - The LLM provider selected in the Workbench
- **API Keys** - Securely retrieved from the platform vault at runtime
- **Base URL** - Custom AI Gateway endpoint (if configured)
- **Model Name** - The specific model version to use

All credentials are stored securely in the vault and automatically injected when your agent runs - you never need to hardcode API keys in your code.

### When to Override the Model

Override the model in your code only when you need to:
- Test with different models without changing Workbench settings
- Use different models for different agent instances
- Switch models dynamically based on runtime conditions
- Run local models (Ollama) for development

<Warning>
When you override `agno_agent.model` in your code, you're responsible for providing the API keys for that model. The platform vault credentials only apply to the default Workbench configuration.
