Turn any OpenAPI/Swagger specification into a fully functional MCP server with AI-optimized tools. Perfect for connecting private APIs and custom services to your MCP clients.


## Quick OpenAPI-to-MCP Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload OpenAPI Specification" titleIcon="upload">
    Go to the [Connectors page](https://app.xpander.ai/connectors) in the xpander.ai console.
    
    1. Click **"+ Create new connector"** 
    2. Upload your OpenAPI/Swagger specification file (JSON or YAML)
    3. Provide a name and description for your connector
    4. Don't forget the server URL, especially if your original spec doesn't have one.
    
    <Tip>Your OpenAPI spec gets automatically analyzed by the connector generator agent!</Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Authentication" titleIcon="key">
    Set up authentication for your API:
    
    **For API Key authentication:**
    1. Select **"API Key"** as the authentication method
    2. Specify the key location (header, query parameter, etc.)
    3. Enter your API key or leave it for later configuration
    
    **Other supported methods:**
    - OAuth 2.0
    - Bearer tokens  
    - Basic authentication
    - No authentication
    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Generated Tools" titleIcon="wrench">
    The connector generator analyzes your API and creates AI-optimized tools:
    
    - **Function descriptions** optimized for LLM understanding
    - **Parameter validation** based on your schema
    - **Response formatting** for better AI consumption
    - **Error handling** built-in
    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create MCP Server" titleIcon="server">
    Navigate to **MCP Servers** section in the console:
    
    1. Click **"New MCP Server"**
    2. Give your MCP server a descriptive name
    3. Go to the **Tools** tab, and click **+ Add tools**
    3. **Select tools** from your newly generated connector
    4. Click **Update changes**
    5. Go to the **Connect** tab to get your MCP Server URL, and one-line commands to hook up your MCP server to your favorite MCP client.
    
    <Success>Your MCP server is now live and ready!</Success>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect MCP Clients" titleIcon="link">
    Add your MCP server to your favorite MCP client using the connection details provided:
    
    <Frame>
    ![MCP Server Connect](/static/images/screenshots/mcp-server-connect.png)
    </Frame>
    
    **For other MCP clients**: Use the provided URL and authentication details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Connecting a Weather API

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sample OpenAPI Spec">
    Here's a simple weather API spec that would generate weather tools:
    
    ```yaml
    openapi: 3.0.0
    info:
      title: Weather API
      version: 1.0.0
    servers:
      - url: https://api.weather.com/v1
    paths:
      /current:
        get:
          summary: Get current weather
          parameters:
            - name: location
              in: query
              required: true
              schema:
                type: string
              description: City name or coordinates
          responses:
            '200':
              description: Current weather data
    security:
      - apiKey: []
    components:
      securitySchemes:
        apiKey:
          type: apiKey
          in: header
          name: X-API-Key
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Generated MCP Tools">
    The connector generator would create:
    
    - **get_current_weather(location)** - Gets current weather for a location
    - **Optimized description**: "Retrieves real-time weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and conditions for any city or coordinates"
    - **Auto-validation**: Ensures location parameter is provided
    - **Error handling**: Graceful handling of API errors with helpful messages
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Usage in Claude">
    Once connected, you can ask Claude:
    
    - "What's the weather like in San Francisco?"
    - "Compare the weather in New York vs London"  
    - "Is it a good day for outdoor activities in Seattle?"
    
    Claude will automatically use your weather API through the MCP server!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Next Step: Self-Deploy Your MCP Server

Your MCP server runs on xpander.ai's cloud, but you can also deploy it to your own infrastructure:

- **[Self-deploy to K8s Cluster](/user-guide/5-minute-wins/k8s-self-deploy)** - Run your MCP servers on your own Kubernetes infrastructure
- **Full control** over data and scaling
- **Enterprise security** with your own network policies

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OpenAPI spec not uploading">
    - Ensure your spec is valid JSON/YAML
    - Check for syntax errors with a tool like Swagger Editor
    - File size should be under 10MB
    - Make sure all required fields are present
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="MCP client can't connect">
    - Verify the MCP URL is copied correctly
    - Check your MCP client configuration syntax
    - Restart your MCP client after configuration changes  
    - Ensure your API keys are properly configured
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tools not working as expected">
    - Review the generated tool descriptions and edit if needed
    - Check API authentication is properly configured
    - Verify your API endpoints are accessible from xpander.ai
    - Test individual tools in the xpander.ai console first
  </Accordion>
