There are two ways to control the AI model of your agents in xpander.

**Centrally Managed** - xpander provides the API keys you configure in the UI (or Pay&Go) and client setup (recommended)

**Bring Your Own Model** - Use your own API keys with any LLM provider client directly in the code

Once you define in the UI the model provider, and the model name, whenever you run the agent a native class of that provider will be provided to the agent.

```python Bring Your Own Model
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent, OpenAIChat

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args(override={'model': OpenAIChat(api_key='your-openai-key')}))
agno_agent.print_response(message="What's your role?")
```

```python Centrally Managed
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())
agno_agent.print_response(message="What's your role?")
```
