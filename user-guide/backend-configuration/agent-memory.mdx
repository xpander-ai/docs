Configure your agent's memory settings in the Workbench to control how it stores and recalls information.

## Memory Types

Each agent includes a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage. Configure which memory types your agent supports using the toggles in the Workbench UI:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Session Storage" icon="database">
    Automatic conversation history and state persistence (always enabled)
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Memories" icon="user">
    Long-term facts and preferences about users ("ChatGPT-style" memory)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Session Summaries" icon="message">
    Automatically summarizes long conversations for future reference
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For advanced use cases, the storage is accessible programmatically via `agno_agent.storage`.

## Using Memory in Your Code

The memory configuration from the Workbench UI is automatically applied to your agent. Use the `user_id` parameter to access user-specific memories and conversation history:

```python
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())  # Memory settings applied from UI
agno_agent.print_response(message="What did we talk about yesterday?", user_id="user123")
```
