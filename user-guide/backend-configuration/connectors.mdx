There are two ways to add tools to your agents in xpander.

**Pre-built Connectors** - Browse and select from 50+ available tools in the UI 

**Custom Tools** - Register your own functions directly in the code

Once you select tools in the UI, they become available to your agent automatically through the backend configuration.

</Frame>

<CodeGroup>

```python Custom Tools
from xpander_sdk import Backend, register_tool
from agno.agent import Agent

@register_tool # Register local tools
def weather_check(location: str) -> str:
    """Check weather for a location"""
    return f"Weather in {location}: Sunny, 25Â°C"

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())
agno_agent.print_response(message="What's the weather in SFO?")
```

```python Pre-built Connectors
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args()) 
agno_agent.print_response(message="Check my calendar")
```
</CodeGroup>

`agno_agent.tools` will now contain the functions from the cloud and the weather_check local tool.

## Authentication

xpander helps you streamline the authentication to the connectors. You can use the agent without configuring pre-defined auth or you can connect it with user authentication or integration user.

## Tool Dependencies

Dependencies force the agent to run one tool only after another has finished. In other words, Tool B will run only after Tool A completes, while Tool A can still run on its own. You can add multiple dependencies to a single tool.

To create a dependency, click on the top connector of the tool that must wait (Tool B) and then click the bottom connector of the tool it depends on (Tool A).

In this example we set the email tool to be available only after checking Calendly.


## Tool Scheme Advanced Tab

When you select an operation in the builder interface, you'll see several configuration tabs that control different aspects of the operation's behavior:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Details">
    The Details tab shows the original, generated function calling description that defines the operation's purpose and behavior. This serves as a reference for the operation's intended use.
    
    <Frame>
    ![Operation Details Tab](/static/images/screenshots/2025-03-15-22-57-40.png)
    </Frame>
    
    This information is especially useful when you're working with multiple similar operations and need to understand the exact purpose of each one.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Instructions">
    The Instructions tab allows you to add custom descriptions to provide more context about the operation. This is particularly useful for:
    
    - Giving the AI agent specific guidance on when to use this operation
    - Explaining nuances about the data returned by the operation
    - Setting expectations about rate limits or performance considerations
    - Providing examples of effective usage patterns

    </Frame>
    
    <Tip>
    Well-crafted instructions can significantly improve your agent's decision-making when choosing and using operations. Be specific about when the operation should and shouldn't be used.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Input Schema">
    The Input Schema tab lets you hard-code parameters to override values that would normally be generated by the AI. This gives you precise control over operation execution, which is useful for:
    
    - Enforcing specific parameter values regardless of AI decisions
    - Setting default values that the AI can override when needed
    - Restricting certain parameters to prevent undesired behaviors
    - Pre-configuring complex parameters that require specific formatting

    </Frame>
    
    <Accordion title="Example: Hard-coding API Keys">
    If your operation requires an API key or authentication token, you can hard-code it in the Input Schema rather than having the AI provide it:
    
    1. Find the parameter that requires the API key (often called `apiKey` or `authToken`)
    2. Click the parameter and enter your key as the default value
    3. Mark it as "Use Default Value" to ensure the AI cannot override it
    
    This keeps sensitive credentials secure while allowing the AI to control other parameters.
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Output Schema">
    The Output Schema tab lets you configure filtering that runs before payload data is returned to the AI. This is extremely valuable for:
    
    - Reducing token usage by removing unnecessary data
    - Removing personally identifiable information (PII)
    - Focusing the AI on the most relevant parts of the response
    - Preventing the AI from seeing sensitive or irrelevant data

    </Frame>
    
    <Accordion title="How Output Filtering Works">
    When you configure the Output Schema, you're essentially creating a template that determines which fields from the API response will be passed to the AI:
    
    1. Expand the schema tree to see all available fields
    2. Toggle fields on/off to include/exclude them from the AI's view
    3. For nested data structures, you can selectively include specific sub-fields
    
    For example, if a LinkedIn profile response contains personal contact information you don't want the AI to access, you can exclude those specific fields while keeping professional details visible.
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Advanced">
    The Advanced tab contains additional settings for specialized use cases:
    
    <Accordion title="Real-time Filtering for Large Payloads">
    For operations that return large amounts of data, the Advanced tab provides real-time filtering capabilities. This allows the AI to perform in-place queries on large API payloads without consuming excessive tokens.
    
    <Frame>
    ![Advanced Filtering Options](/static/images/screenshots/2025-03-15-22-59-29.png)
    </Frame>
    
    This is especially useful when working with:
    - Large datasets with hundreds or thousands of records
    - APIs that return verbose responses with many fields
    - Data that requires complex filtering logic
    
    The AI can specify search criteria at runtime, and only matching results will be returned, dramatically reducing token usage and improving response times.
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
