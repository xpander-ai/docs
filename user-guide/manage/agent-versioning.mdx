## What Gets Versioned

Every aspect of your agent is tracked:

| Component | Tracked Changes |
|-----------|----------------|
| System Prompt | Content, parameters, model settings |
| Tools | Added, removed, or reconfigured tools |
| Configuration | Model selection, temperature, tokens |
| Knowledge Base | Document additions and removals |
| Connections | OAuth and API key changes |

## Version Management

### Creating Versions

Versions are created automatically when you:

- Save changes in the Workbench
- Deploy via CLI or SDK
- Import an agent configuration

```bash
# Deploy creates a new version
xpander deploy --message "Added GitHub integration"
```

### Viewing Version History

Access version history in the Workbench under **Agent Settings > Versions**:

```
v12 (current) - 2 hours ago - "Updated system prompt for clarity"
v11 - 1 day ago - "Added Slack connector"
v10 - 3 days ago - "Increased max tokens to 4096"
v9 - 1 week ago - "Initial production deployment"
```
