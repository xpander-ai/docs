## Free Tier

Every account includes free resources each month to help you get started:

- **100 threads** - enough for development and testing
- **10 files** - upload documents for your agents
- **100 function calls** - test tool integrations
- **100 interactions** - API requests to your agents
- **1M input tokens** - prompt your agents extensively
- **100K output tokens** - receive agent responses
- **1 cloud agent container** - run one always-on agent
- **1 cloud MCP container** - host one custom tool server

<Tip>
  Many small projects stay within the free tier. No credit card required to start.
</Tip>

## How Packs Work

When you exceed the free tier, you purchase **packs** - bundles of resources at fixed prices:

1. **Usage accrues** throughout the month
2. **Free tier is consumed first**
3. **Packs are automatically purchased** to cover additional usage
4. **You're billed monthly** for the total packs used

**Example:** If you use 5,000 threads:

- First 100 threads: Free
- Remaining 4,900 threads: Requires 5 packs (1,000 threads per $10 pack) = $50
