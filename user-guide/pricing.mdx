- **100 function calls** - Tool executions and API calls
- **100 interactions** - Agent API requests
- **1M input tokens** - LLM prompt processing
- **100K output tokens** - LLM response generation
- **5 free managed agents** - Event-driven agents that scale on-demand
- **1 free embedded agent container** - Full container with 1 vCPU and 1GB RAM, always-on
- **1 free cloud MCP container** - always-on MCP Container

## Pay-As-You-Go Pricing

The free tier works without a credit card. When you exceed free tier limits, you'll need to add a credit card to continue. This activates pay-as-you-go mode and removes usage caps.

**How it works:**

1. **Start free** - No credit card required, use the free tier indefinitely
2. **Reach free tier limit** - Your agents pause when you hit monthly limits
3. **Add payment** - Add a credit card to remove caps and activate pay-as-you-go
4. **Automatic billing** - Pay only for usage beyond free tier (billed monthly in packs)

Usage beyond free tiers is billed monthly in packs (fixed bundles of resources at set prices).

| Resource          | Free Tier | Pack Size               | Pack Price |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Threads           | 100       | 1,000                   | $10        |
| Files (≤50MB)     | 10        | 100                     | $10        |
| Function Calls    | 100       | 100,000                 | $10        |
| Interactions      | 100       | 200,000                 | $10        |
| LLM Input Tokens  | 1M        | 1M                      | $2.50      |
| LLM Output Tokens | 100K      | 1M                      | $10        |
| Managed Agents    | 5         | 10                      | $50        |
| Embedded Agents   | 1         | 1 container (1vCPU/1GB) | $20        |
| Cloud MCPs        | 1         | 1 container             | $20        |
| Builder Seats     | 5         | 1 seat                  | $49        |

### How Packs Work

Packs are bundles of resources you purchase when you exceed free tier limits. **You only buy what you need** - if your usage fits within one pack, you only pay for one pack.

**Example calculations:**

- **150 threads used:** 100 free + 50 billable = 1 pack needed (pack contains 1,000) = **$10**
- **440 threads used:** 100 free + 340 billable = 1 pack needed (pack contains 1,000) = **$10**
- **5,000 threads used:** 100 free + 4,900 billable = 5 packs needed (4,900 ÷ 1,000 = 4.9, rounded up) = **$50**

**How it works:**

1. Your usage accumulates throughout the month
2. Free tier is consumed first
3. Additional usage is covered by automatic pack purchases
4. You're billed monthly for total packs consumed
