## Pay Only for What You Use

Xpander offers **consumption-based pricing** with no upfront commitments or minimum fees. Start small and scale as your agent applications grow—you only pay for the resources you consume.

## Free Tier Included

Every account includes generous monthly limits at no cost:

- **100 threads** - Conversation sessions with your agents
- **10 files** - Document uploads (up to 50MB each)
- **100 function calls** - Tool executions and API calls
- **100 interactions** - Agent API requests
- **1M input tokens** - LLM prompt processing
- **100K output tokens** - LLM response generation
- **1 cloud agent** - Always-on containerized agent
- **1 cloud MCP** - Model Context Protocol server

## Cloud Pricing

Usage beyond free tiers is billed monthly in packs—fixed bundles of resources at set prices.

| Resource | Pack Size | Pack Price |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Threads | 1,000 | $10 |
| Files (≤50MB) | 100 | $10 |
| Function Calls | 100,000 | $10 |
| Interactions | 200,000 | $10 |
| LLM Input Tokens | 1M | $2.50 |
| LLM Output Tokens | 1M | $10 |
| Serverless Agents | 10 | $50 |
| Cloud Agents | 1 container (1vCPU/1GB) | $20 |
| Cloud MCPs | 1 container | $20 |
| Builder Seats | 1 seat | $49 |

### How It Works

1. Your usage accumulates throughout the month
2. Free tier consumption is applied first
3. Additional usage is covered by automatic pack purchases
4. You're billed monthly for total packs consumed

**Example:** Using 5,000 threads consumes 100 free threads, then requires 5 packs (4,900 ÷ 1,000) = $50.
