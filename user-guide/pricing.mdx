## Start Free, Scale When Ready

Xpander starts with a **free tier** designed for hobbyists and startups to launch projects without worrying about costs. Our mission is to make AI infrastructure invisible.

Every account includes monthly limits at no cost:

- **100 threads** - Conversation sessions with your agents
- **10 files** - Document uploads (up to 50MB each)
- **100 function calls** - Tool executions and API calls
- **100 interactions** - Agent API requests
- **1M input tokens** - LLM prompt processing
- **100K output tokens** - LLM response generation
- **1 cloud agent** - Always-on containerized agent
- **1 cloud MCP** - Model Context Protocol server

## Pay-As-You-Go Pricing

Add a credit card to enable pay-as-you-go mode. You'll still pay $0 until you exceed the free tier limits—adding payment simply removes usage caps so your agents keep running.

**How it works:**

1. **Start free** - No credit card required to begin building
2. **Add payment** - Add a credit card to remove usage limits
3. **Keep using free tier** - Pay $0 as long as you stay within monthly free limits
4. **Automatic billing** - Only pay when you exceed free tier limits (billed monthly in packs)

Usage beyond free tiers is billed monthly in packs—fixed bundles of resources at set prices.

| Resource | Pack Size | Pack Price |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Threads | 1,000 | $10 |
| Files (≤50MB) | 100 | $10 |
| Function Calls | 100,000 | $10 |
| Interactions | 200,000 | $10 |
| LLM Input Tokens | 1M | $2.50 |
| LLM Output Tokens | 1M | $10 |
| Serverless Agents | 10 | $50 |
| Cloud Agents | 1 container (1vCPU/1GB) | $20 |
| Cloud MCPs | 1 container | $20 |
| Builder Seats | 1 seat | $49 |

### How It Works

1. Your usage accumulates throughout the month
2. Free tier consumption is applied first
3. Additional usage is covered by automatic pack purchases
4. You're billed monthly for total packs consumed

**Example:** Using 5,000 threads consumes 100 free threads, then requires 5 packs (4,900 ÷ 1,000) = $50.

## Pricing Examples

### Weekly Report Generator (Free)

Agent that pulls data from 3 sources, analyzes trends, and emails a report to 10 people every Monday.

**What happens weekly:**

- 1 scheduled execution = 1 thread
- Fetch from 3 APIs + analyze + send email = 5 function calls
- 1 scheduled trigger = 1 interaction

**Monthly usage (4 weeks):**

- 4 threads (within 100 free)
- 20 function calls (within 100 free)
- 4 interactions (within 100 free)

**Monthly cost:** **$0** - completely free

---

### Database Q&A Agent ($20/month)

AI agent that answers questions from your database. 5 teammates ask 1 question daily (5 messages × 30 days = 150 messages/month). Each query performs 2 database lookups.

**What happens each day:**

- 5 messages from different teammates = 5 threads
- Each message triggers 2 database queries = 10 function calls
- 5 API requests to the agent = 5 interactions

**Monthly usage:**

- 150 threads (100 free + 1 pack = $10)
- 300 function calls (100 free + 1 pack = $10)
- 150 interactions (100 free + 1 pack = $10)

**Monthly cost:** **$20** or **$0.67/day** for your whole team

---

### One-Time Training Data Generator ($10)

Build a structured dataset of 500 JSON records for model training. Agent runs once, processes 500 items with 30 validation actions per item.

**What happens:**

- 1 agent session = 1 thread
- 500 items × 30 validations = 15,000 function calls
- 1 API invocation = 1 interaction
- No history needed (stateless processing)

**Total usage:**

- 1 thread (within 100 free)
- 15,000 function calls (100 free + 1 pack = $10)
- 1 interaction (within 100 free)

**Total cost:** **$10 one-time** to generate your entire training dataset

---

### Slack Assistant for Small Team ($109/month)

10 employees use a Slack bot for quick lookups (check PTO balance, find docs, create tickets). Average 2 questions per person per day.

**What happens daily:**

- 20 questions = 20 threads
- Each question hits 1 internal API = 20 function calls
- 20 Slack messages = 20 interactions

**Monthly usage (22 workdays):**

- 440 threads (100 free + 4 packs = $40)
- 440 function calls (100 free + 1 pack = $10)
- 440 interactions (100 free + 1 pack = $10)
- 1 builder seat = $49

**Monthly cost:** **$109** or **$10.90 per employee** for unlimited questions

### Document Processor ($50/month)

Process 200 customer contracts monthly, extract key terms, update CRM. Each contract is 1 PDF with 5 data points to extract.

**What happens per contract:**

- 1 document upload = 1 file + 1 thread
- Extract 5 data points + update CRM = 6 function calls
- 1 processing request = 1 interaction

**Monthly usage (200 contracts):**

- 200 files (10 free + 2 packs = $20)
- 200 threads (100 free + 1 pack = $10)
- 1,200 function calls (100 free + 1 pack = $10)
- 200 interactions (100 free + 1 pack = $10)

**Monthly cost:** **$50** or **$0.25 per contract** processed
