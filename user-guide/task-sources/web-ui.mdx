**Instant UI Generation** - Professional interface in minutes

**Thread Management** - Multiple conversation threads per user

**Built-in Authentication** - SSO, platform auth, or custom rules

```python
from xpander_sdk import Backend  
from agno.agent import Agent

backend = Backend()
web_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())
# Web UI automatically generated when deployed
```

## Configuration

Set up through the "Human Interfaces" tab in agent settings:

- Title, description, and appearance
- Conversation starters for new users  
- Authentication method selection
- Access restrictions and permissions

Deploy generates a shareable URL for your agent's web interface. Can be embedded in existing applications using standard iframe.

## Authentication Options

- **Platform Auth**: Built-in user management with registration/login
- **SSO Integration**: SAML/OAuth with enterprise providers  
- **Custom Rules**: Role-based access and restrictions
