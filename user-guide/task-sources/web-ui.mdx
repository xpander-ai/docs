## Configuration

The Web UI can be set up through the "Connect" tab in the Workbench. Deploy creates a shareable URL for your agent's web interface. Can be embedded in existing applications using standard iframe.


```python
from xpander_sdk import Backend  
from agno.agent import Agent

backend = Backend()
web_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())
# Web UI automatically available when deployed
```
