Connect MCP clients to your agents and tools. Three integration patterns: compose operations across connectors, trigger full agents, or expose individual connectors.

**MCP Composition** - Pick operations from multiple connectors for fine-grained control

**Agent Triggers** - Run complete agents from Claude Desktop or other MCP clients

**Individual Connectors** - Expose single tools (GitHub, Jira, etc.) to MCP clients

```python
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

backend = Backend()
agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())
# MCP URLs generated through UI for each integration type
```

## Configuration

1. **MCP Composition**: Select specific operations from multiple connectors in MCP Servers section
2. **Agent MCP**: Add MCP source in agent settings to generate trigger URL  
3. **Connector MCP**: Enable MCP in individual connector settings

Add to Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xpander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["xpander-mcp-remote", "https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-url/"]
    }
  }
}
```
