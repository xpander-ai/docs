<Card title="MCP Composition" icon="puzzle-piece">
Pick-and-choose tools from multiple connectors and connect your MCP clients to a fine-grained, controlled list of tools.
</Card>

<Card title="MCP to AI Agents" icon="robot">
You can trigger AI Agents running on the xpander.ai platform from your MCP clients.
</Card>

<Card title="Specific Connectors" icon="plug">
You can connect individual Connectors to MCP clients.

</CardGroup>

See below for walkthroughs of these three usage patterns.

### Using the xpander.ai MCP Servers hosting solution with Claude Desktop

<Tabs>
<Tab title="MCP Composition">
In this option, you can select individual tools from multiple connectors, thus composing a list of tools in various systems that will be available to your MCP client.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the MCP Servers menu">
    In the xpander.ai console (https://app.xpander.ai), go to the MCP Servers section
    <Frame>
    ![alt text](/static/images/screenshots/mcp-servers1.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new MCP Server">
    Click on "New MCP Server", and provide a name and description for your MCP Server
    <Frame>
    ![alt text](/static/images/screenshots/mcp-server-name.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select tools">
    In this step, you can select tools from one or more connectors, which will be composed in your MCP server, and available to your MCP clients. 
    <Frame>
    ![alt text](/static/images/screenshots/mcp-server-selection.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the MCP Server to Claude">
    After selecting your tools, copy the MCP Server address from the page, and add it to your MCP Client. For example:

    ```json
    {
      "globalShortcut": "Alt+Space",
      "mcpServers": {
        "slack": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "xpander-mcp-remote",
            "https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-mcp-url/"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
</Steps>
</Tab>


<Tab title="Single connector">
In this option, you create an MCP server for an entire Connector and connect it to Claude Desktop. For example, Github, Jira, Asana.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Connector Settings">
    Open https://app.xpander.ai
    In the settings menu, click on "Connectors".
    <Frame>
    ![alt text](/static/images/screenshots/agentic-interfaces.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a specific Connector">
    In the Connectors panel, select the specific application (e.g., Slack, HubSpot)
    <Frame>
    ![alt text](/static/images/screenshots/specific-interface.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on MCP Configuration">
    Find and click on the "MCP Configuration" option.
    <Frame>![alt text](/static/images/screenshots/mcp-configuration.png)</Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the MCP Server to Claude">
    Add a configuration snippet like the following, replacing the URL with your specific xpander MCP endpoint: (The file is located at '~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json')

    ```json
    {
      "globalShortcut": "Alt+Space",
      "mcpServers": {
        "slack": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "xpander-mcp-remote",
            "https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-mcp-url/"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Agents as MCP Servers">
In this option, you trigger AI Agents on the xpander.ai platform from your MCP Client.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Agent Settings">
    Open https://app.xpander.ai and go to the `Task sources` tab, enable the MCP toggle
      <Frame>
    ![alt text](/static/images/screenshots/workbench-settings-mcp.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="MCP Server url">
    Copy the MCP configuration and add it in your MCP-compatible client (Claude Dekstop etc')

    <Frame>
    ![alt text](/static/images/screenshots/agent-mcp-server.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>
  When using an agent as MCP, Claude can:
  - Send tasks to the agent for execution
  - Query the agent's status for long-running tasks
  - Access all agent capabilities through a single MCP server
  - Each team member gets their own MCP URL with their specific API key and permissions
</Tip>

</Tab>


</Tabs>

# Other considerations

<Warning>
  The MCP URL contains your API key, so never share it publicly. Treat it as a sensitive credential.
</Warning>

You can add multiple MCP servers to your configuration file by adding them to the `mcpServers` object. Each server should have a unique key:

```json
{
  "globalShortcut": "Alt+Space",
  "mcpServers": {
    "linkedin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "xpander-mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-linkedin-mcp-url/"
      ]
    },
    "gmail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "xpander-mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-gmail-mcp-url/"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Instead of manually editing the configuration file, you can use the MCP installer by adding this to your configuration file at '~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json':
  ```json
  "mcp-installer": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "@anaisbetts/mcp-installer"
    ]
  }
  ```
  Then simply ask Claude to install your MCP URL, and it will handle the installation automatically.
</Tip>

### Working with Authenticated Connectors

If you've already configured authentication for connectors in xpander.ai (such as Gmail, LinkedIn, or other services), they will work automatically with the provided MCP URL without requiring additional authentication steps in Claude.

For example, if you've already connected your Gmail account in xpander.ai:

1. Add the xpander MCP configuration to Claude as shown above
2. You can immediately use Gmail capabilities in Claude through natural language
3. No additional authentication steps are needed in Claude


### Testing Your MCP Integration

Once configured, you can test your integration by asking Claude to perform actions using the connected service:

1. For LinkedIn: "Can you search for AI Product Managers on LinkedIn?"
2. For Gmail: "Could you check my recent unread emails?"
3. For Weather: "What's the weather like in San Francisco today?"

Claude will seamlessly connect to the xpander MCP server and utilize its agentic interfaces to fulfill your requests.
