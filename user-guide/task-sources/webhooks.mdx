Webhooks enable you to trigger xpander.ai agents from any external system that can make HTTP requests. Each agent has a unique webhook URL for programmatic interaction.

## Accessing Your Webhook URL

To find your webhook URL:
1. Navigate to your agent in the Workbench and go to the `Task sources` tab.
2. Toggle to enable the Webhook Task source and click `Configure and test`
3. The Webhook Configuration panel will open, providing a curl snippet and the ability to test the webhook from the Workbench.

## Making Webhook Requests

### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `agent_id` | string | The unique identifier of your agent |
| `x-api-key` | string | Your API key for authentication (header or query parameter) |
| `asynchronous` | boolean | Whether to wait for completion (`false`) or return immediately (`true`) |

### Request Body Options

| Option | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `files` | file | One or more files to process (PDF, PNG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP) |
| `prompt` | string | A text prompt to send to the agent |

<Warning>
When uploading files, you must send the actual files using `multipart/form-data`. Direct external URLs to files are not supported as inputs. The platform will generate secure presigned URLs for your agent to access the uploaded files.
</Warning>

### Content Types

- **With files**: Use `multipart/form-data` (curl handles this automatically with `--form`)
- **JSON only**: Use `application/json` with the appropriate header

## File Handling

### Supported File Types

xpander.ai supports a variety of file formats:
- Documents: PDF
- Images: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP

### Uploading Multiple Files

To process multiple files in a single request:

```bash
curl --location "https://webhook.xpander.ai?asynchronous=true" \
--header "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
--form "prompt=Process these documents" \
--form "files=@/path/to/first-file.pdf" \
--form "files=@/path/to/second-file.pdf" \
--form "files=@/path/to/image.png" \
--form "agent_id=YOUR_AGENT_ID"
```

For large batches of files (10+ files), we recommend:
1. Using asynchronous mode (`asynchronous=true`)
2. Breaking uploads into multiple requests of 5-10 files each
3. Using a dedicated file uploader with retry capabilities

### File URL Mechanism

When you upload files through the webhook:

1. xpander.ai automatically handles storage of your files
2. Your agent receives secure presigned URLs to access these files
3. These URLs remain valid for 30 days after upload
4. Files are accessible only to your organization's agents

<Info>
All uploaded files are stored securely on our platform. Your agent doesn't need to handle file storage or download logic - it will automatically receive properly formatted URLs to access the files.
</Info>

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Requests

### Synchronous Mode

```bash
curl --location "https://webhook.xpander.ai?asynchronous=false" \
--header "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"agent_id": "YOUR_AGENT_ID", "prompt": "What can you do?"}'
```

- HTTP request remains open until agent completes
- Returns complete execution details and results
- Best for immediate responses and short tasks

**Response:**

```json
{
  "result": {
    "id": "9642f5dd-e535-465f-bdaf-89be6ecaa2d5",
    "status": "completed",
    "result": "I specialize in extracting text from image and PDF files using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. If you provide me with a file in a supported format (pdf, png, jpeg, gif, webp), I can extract the text content for you.",
    "source": "webhook"
  }
}
```

### Asynchronous Mode

```bash
curl --location "https://webhook.xpander.ai?asynchronous=true" \
--header "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"agent_id": "YOUR_AGENT_ID", "prompt": "What can you do?"}'
```

- Returns immediately while agent processes in background
- Best for long-running tasks and large file processing
- Allows your application to continue execution

**Response:**

```json
{
  "result": "Started"
}
```

## Example: OCR Document Processing

This example shows how to extract text from a document using the OCR agent:

```bash
curl --location "https://webhook.xpander.ai?asynchronous=false" \
--header "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
--form "prompt=Extract text from this document" \
--form "files=@/path/to/your/document.pdf" \
--form "agent_id=YOUR_AGENT_ID"
```

<Info>
The OCR agent handles multiple document formats (PDFs and images) and preserves formatting when possible, including tables and structured content.
</Info>

### Sample OCR Result

```json
{
  "result": {
    "id": "07d6f375-53e9-4aa3-a7af-c36ce99a07d8",
    "status": "completed",
    "result": "## Financial Statement\n\n## ACCOUNT SUMMARY FOR PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n\n| Description | Amount | Percentage |\n|------------|--------|------------|\n| Opening Balance | 50,000 | - |\n| Deposits | 25,000 | - |\n| Withdrawals | (10,000) | - |\n| Fees | (1,500) | 3% |\n| Interest | 1,200 | 2.4% |\n| Closing Balance | 64,700 | - |",
    "source": "webhook"
  }
}
```
