Deploy agents to any Slack workspace with zero infrastructure. Agents can auto-engage in channels, handle files, and integrate with your existing workflows.

**Auto-Engage** - Agents respond automatically based on conditions ("When user asks about stock price")

**File Processing** - OCR images, transcribe audio, read PDFs automatically

**Conversation Starters** - Predefined prompts to guide user interactions

```python
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

# Your agent automatically inherits Slack capabilities
backend = Backend()
slack_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())
```

## Setup Options

Configure Slack integration through the UI, then your agent gains native Slack features:

- Auto-engage based on message content
- Process multimedia (images, audio, PDFs)
- Thread management and user context
- Conversation starters for new users
