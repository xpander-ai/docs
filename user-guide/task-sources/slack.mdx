Once your Slack integration is configured in the Workbench, your agent code remains simple and clean. The backend automatically handles all Slack-specific functionality:

```python
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

# Your agent automatically inherits Slack capabilities
backend = Backend()
slack_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())
```

The `backend.get_args()` method includes all your Slack configuration, so your agent can immediately respond to Slack messages, process files, and use conversation history without any additional code.
