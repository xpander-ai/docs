<Note>
**Module Summary**
* **Goal**: Create a manager agent to orchestrate your developer agents
* **Estimated Time**: 10-20 minutes
* **Prerequisites**: Two developer agents from Module 3, GitHub account
</Note>

🚀 In this module, you'll use the visual Agent Workbench to design your manager agent, configure it to coordinate your existing agents, test it in the platform, and connect it to your development workflow!

## 🔧 Access the xpander.ai Workbench

First, let's access the xpander.ai platform to create your manager agent:

1. Go to [https://app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai) and sign in with your credentials
2. In the left navigation menu, go to **AI Agents**
3. Click the **New AI Agent** button to open the Workbench and click "Skip" when prompted by the agent builder. This time we'll create the agent manually.

Click on the plus icon on the right, and select the two agents you created from the menu.

<Note>
In just a few minutes, we've exposed two agents to the manager agent, allowing it to delegate tasks using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. Behind the scenes, the xpander.ai platform creates function calling capabilities with each agent and exposes them at runtime (agent.get_tools() will now return agents as well as tools). This allows you to dynamically add tools or agents and let the xpander platform handle protocols and task delegations.
</Note>

Now let's add tools to the manager:

1. Add the "GitHub Pull Requests" app by authenticating to GitHub
2. Select two operations:
   - Create New Pull Request in Repository
   - List Pull Requests in Repository

Your agent should now look like this:

## ⚙️ Configure the Manager Agent

Now let's configure the manager agent:

1. Navigate to the Settings tab
2. Click on "Generate Details"
3. Enter the following prompt:

> An AI agent that manages two AI developers. For each task assigned by the user, both developers independently work on their respective branches. The manager agent reviews both implementations and selects the branch to proceed with a pull request (PR). This setup ensures parallel development and allows the manager to choose the optimal solution.

## Customize the prompts further 

```txt Role
You are the AI Manager, a rapid-execution orchestrator that turns each feature request into a finished pull request in under five minutes. You own every step—from scoping to branch control to the final merge-ready PR—while two developer agents do the coding under your direction.
```

```txt Goal
Convert a user’s idea into working, test-passing code on a single feature branch, with one clean pull request you create yourself, all within the five-minute wall-clock budget.
```

```txt Instructions
When a request arrives, immediately check whether you have the scope, edge cases, acceptance tests, and target branch name. If anything is missing, fire one concise multi-part question to fill the gaps; do not proceed until you have those answers or have supplied sensible defaults. With full context in hand, break the work into exactly two non-overlapping tasks—one for dev-agent-1ProcessSubTaskWithContext, one for dev-agent-2ProcessSubTaskWithContextInsights—embed the confirmed branch name, and remind them never to open pull requests. Dispatch both tasks in parallel and monitor progress; if an error surfaces, issue a corrective instruction at once. As soon as both tasks meet the acceptance criteria, create or update a single pull request against the target branch, write a crisp description, verify that tests pass, and then invoke xpfinish-agent-execution-finished with a one-sentence completion report containing the branch and PR link. Maintain executive tone, keep messages short, avoid unnecessary loops, and never let the total turnaround exceed five minutes.
```

Once you've finished configuring your agent, click "Save" and then "Deploy"!

Your AI Manager is now ready to use:

## 🧪 Testing Your Manager Agent

Use the Tester tab to interact with your manager agent. Test its ability to create pull requests and coordinate your developer agents.

```txt Prompt-1
Develop finance dashboard app and add it to xpander-ai/apps-by-agents in branch may-2025/xpander-ai/finance-app
```

## 🔌 Connecting to MCP

Now that our AI team is set up, we can add Model Context Protocol (MCP) support and connect our IDE to the manager.

1. Click on the plus icon and select "Sources" -> "MCP"
2. Once added to the canvas, click "Deploy" to save the changes
3. Click on the MCP icon to get a unique server address with your agents ready to receive tasks

<Frame caption="Adding MCP to your manager agent" alt="Screenshot showing MCP configuration">

</Frame>

<Warning>
This URL contains API keys for your agents. Don't share this URL with anyone.
</Warning>

<Tip>
You can add MCP to anything - tools, agents, multiple agents. Think of MCP as a REST API for the agent ecosystem. AI agents use it to load tools, but you can use it to interact with agents or tools directly as well!
</Tip>

Now, load this URL into Cursor by going to Cursor settings -> MCP or (`vi ~/.cursor/mcp.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers":{
	"ai_development_manager": {
	  "command": "npx",
	  "args": [
		"xpander-mcp-remote",
		"https://mcp.xpander.ai/<your-mcp>/"
	  ]
	}
  }
}
```

You should be able to see the MCP auto-added to all your cursor chat

Trigger your manager agent with `Can you ask the AI Manager if it's working today?`

## ✅ Checkpoint

By completing this module, you should now be able to:

1. Create a manager agent using the xpander.ai Workbench
2. Configure the manager to coordinate your developer agents
3. Add GitHub Pull Request capabilities to your manager
4. Connect your manager agent to Cursor IDE using MCP
5. Test the manager's ability to delegate tasks to your developer agents

## 🔄 Next Steps

Now that you've built your manager agent with MCP support, you're ready to move on to the final step of this workshop - submitting your application. In the [next module](/workshops/a2a-mcp-bedrock-workshop/05-submit-application), you'll finalize your project and prepare it for submission.
