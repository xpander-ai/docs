## Introduction

The **Agents Module** provides comprehensive functionality for managing AI agents, creating tasks, and executing workflows within the xpander.ai platform.

## Overview

In this module, you can:

- List, retrieve, and manage multiple AI agents
- Load specific agents and interact with their components
- Manage tasks, tools, and knowledge bases associated with each agent
- Access configurable elements like MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers

## Examples

### Listing all Agents

This example demonstrates how to list all available agents in both asynchronous and synchronous styles.

#### Asynchronous Example

Using `alist()` to retrieve agents asynchronously:

```python
from xpander_sdk import Agents

agents = Agents()
agents_list = await agents.alist()
for agent in agents_list:
    print(f"Agent: {agent.name} (ID: {agent.id})")
```

#### Synchronous Example

Using `list()` to retrieve agents synchronously:

```python
from xpander_sdk import Agents

agents = Agents()
agents_list = agents.list()
for agent in agents_list:
    print(f"Agent: {agent.name} (ID: {agent.id})")
```

### Loading a Specific Agent

Learn how to load a specific agent by its ID, which allows you to interact with its tools and tasks.

#### Asynchronous Example

```python
agent = await agents.aget("agent-123")
print(f"Agent name: {agent.name}")
```

#### Synchronous Example

```python
agent = agents.get("agent-123")
print(f"Agent name: {agent.name}")
```

### Creating and Managing Tasks

This section illustrates creating, managing, and executing tasks assigned to agents.

#### Asynchronous Example

```python
task = await agent.acreate_task(
    prompt="Analyze this dataset",
    file_urls=["https://example.com/data.csv"],
    events_streaming=True,
    output_format=OutputFormat.Json
)
```

#### Synchronous Example

```python
task = agent.create_task(
    prompt="Analyze this dataset",
    file_urls=["https://example.com/data.csv"],
    events_streaming=True,
    output_format=OutputFormat.Json
)
```
