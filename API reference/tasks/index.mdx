## Introduction

The **Tasks Module** provides comprehensive functionality for managing task execution, monitoring progress, and streaming real-time events within the xpander.ai platform.

## Overview

In this module, you can:

- Create and execute tasks with detailed configuration options
- Monitor task execution status and progress in real-time
- Track custom internal status (up to 255 characters) alongside system status
- Stream task events for responsive application development
- Manage task lifecycle including stopping and updating tasks
- Handle both synchronous and asynchronous task operations

## Examples

### Creating and Executing Tasks

This example demonstrates how to create and execute tasks with both asynchronous and synchronous approaches.

#### Asynchronous Example

Using `acreate()` to create tasks asynchronously:

```python
from xpander_sdk import Tasks

tasks = Tasks()
task = await tasks.acreate(
    agent_id="agent-123",
    prompt="Analyze the sales data",
    file_urls=["https://example.com/sales_data.csv"],
    events_streaming=True
)
print(f"Created task: {task.id}")
```

#### Synchronous Example

Using `create()` to create tasks synchronously:

```python
from xpander_sdk import Tasks

tasks = Tasks()
task = tasks.create(
    agent_id="agent-123",
    prompt="Analyze the sales data",
    file_urls=["https://example.com/sales_data.csv"]
)
print(f"Created task: {task.id}")
```

### Retrieving Task Status

Learn how to retrieve and monitor task execution status.

#### Asynchronous Example

```python
task = await tasks.aget("task-456")
print(f"Task status: {task.status}")
print(f"Task result: {task.result}")
```

#### Synchronous Example

```python
task = tasks.get("task-456")
print(f"Task status: {task.status}")
print(f"Task result: {task.result}")
```

### Streaming Task Events

Monitor real-time task execution with event streaming.

#### Asynchronous Example

```python
async for event in task.aevents():
    print(f"Event: {event.type} at {event.time}")
    
    if event.type == "task_finished":
        print("Task completed!")
        break
```

#### Synchronous Example

```python
for event in task.events():
    print(f"Event: {event.type}")
    
    if event.type == "task_finished":
        print("Task completed!")
        break
```

### Managing Task Lifecycle

Control task execution with update and stop operations.

#### Asynchronous Example

```python
# Stop a running task
stopped_task = await tasks.astop("task-456")
print(f"Task {stopped_task.id} has been stopped")

# Update task status
updated_task = await tasks.aupdate(
    task_id="task-456",
    status=AgentExecutionStatus.Completed,
    result="Analysis completed successfully"
)
```

#### Synchronous Example

```python
# Stop a running task
stopped_task = tasks.stop("task-456")
print(f"Task {stopped_task.id} has been stopped")

# Update task status
updated_task = tasks.update(
    task_id="task-456",
    status=AgentExecutionStatus.Completed,
    result="Analysis completed successfully"
)
```

### File Handling for Agno Integration

Demonstrate how to work with tasks that have file attachments and integrate them with Agno agents.

#### Working with Files and Images

```python
# Create a task with various file types
task = await tasks.acreate(
    agent_id="agent-123",
    prompt="Analyze the attached documents and images",
    file_urls=[
        "https://example.com/report.pdf",      # PDF document
        "https://example.com/chart.png",       # Image file
        "https://example.com/data.csv",        # Human-readable file
        "https://example.com/logo.jpg"         # Another image
    ]
)

# Get files categorized by type for Agno integration
files = task.get_files()    # Returns Agno File objects for PDFs
images = task.get_images()  # Returns Agno Image objects for images
readable_files = task.get_human_readable_files()  # Returns content of text files

print(f"Found {len(files)} PDF files")
print(f"Found {len(images)} image files")
print(f"Found {len(readable_files)} readable files")
```

#### Agno Integration Example

```python
from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

# Initialize Agno agent with xpander backend
backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())

# Pass files and images directly to Agno
result = await agno_agent.arun(
    input=task.to_message(),  # Includes text + file URLs + readable content
    files=files,              # PDF files as Agno File objects
    images=images            # Image files as Agno Image objects
)

print(f"Analysis result: {result.content}")
```
