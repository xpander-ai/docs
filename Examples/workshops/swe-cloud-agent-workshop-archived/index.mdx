## SWE Cloud Agent Workshop

![swe cloud agent banner](/images/examples/workshops/github_agent.png)


## Workshop introduction

What this workshop covers:

- Running a customizable SWE agent in the cloud, with built-in tools: Coding (based on Codex CLI) and Github access
- Running agents on a managed Backend-as-a-Service platform, designed specifically for AI agents
- Deploy a Codex-GPT style frontend for managing the SWE agent tasks, logs and status
- Configure and test your AI Agent through a visual Workbench

End goal: A fully customizable version of ChatGPT-Codex, controlled and configured by you, ready to take on coding tasks, connect to any tool and agent, and be triggered from anywhere.
