<Frame>
  ![A2A Workshop Banner](/images/examples/workshops/Github.png)
</Frame>

In this workshop, you'll build AI agents with xpander.ai and Amazon Bedrock. You'll create agents that work together to help with coding and development tasks.

When finished, you'll have a GitHub agent in your IDE, two coding agents, and a manager agent that coordinates them. You'll use these agents to build and submit a sample application.

## What You'll Learn

This workshop teaches you:

- When to use A2A for agent communication vs. MCP for tool access
- How to use Agentic RAG to handle large API responses
- Converting agents from different frameworks to work together
- Adding tools to agents and setting up specific behaviors
- Monitoring agent systems during operation
