### Virtual Environment Setup
```bash setup.sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "xpander-sdk[agno]"
```

### Environment Setup
The `.env` file is created when you download your agent code:

```bash
xpander init
```

This downloads your agent code from the platform with the `.env` file pre-configured with your keys.

```python session_management_example.py
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())

# Tom's first session
agno_agent.print_response(
    message="Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot.", 
    user_id="tom", 
    session_id="tom_session1"
)

# Jerry's session
agno_agent.print_response(
    message="How many b in rabbit?", 
    user_id="jerry", 
    session_id="jerry_session1"
)

# Tom recalls his session
agno_agent.print_response(
    message="who am I, What did I ask you?", 
    user_id="tom", 
    session_id="tom_session1"
)
```

## How to Run

```bash session_management_example.py
python session_management_example.py
```

This example shows user-specific memory where each user maintains separate conversation history, session isolation with clear boundaries between different contexts, and flexible access patterns. Tasks automatically include user sessions, making it seamless to maintain context in background processing without manual session management.

## Production Deployment

For creating and deploying agents to production, see the [Setup and Deployment Guide](/Examples/00-setup-deployment).
