### Virtual Environment Setup
```bash setup.sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "xpander-sdk[agno]"
```

### Environment Setup
The `.env` file is created when you download your agent code:

```bash
xpander init
```

This downloads your agent code from the platform with the `.env` file pre-configured with your keys.

```python hello_world_example.py
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from xpander_sdk import Backend
from agno.agent import Agent

# Initialize Xpander Backend
backend = Backend()

# Create agent with backend configuration
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())

# Test stateful conversation
agno_agent.print_response(message="What's your role?")
agno_agent.print_response(message="What did I ask you?")
```

## How to Run

```bash hello_world_example.py
python hello_world_example.py
```

This example shows Xpander Backend integration providing automatic agent configuration, centralized management through the dashboard, and stateful memory where the agent remembers previous interactions and maintains context across multiple messages.

## Production Deployment

For creating and deploying agents to production, see the [Setup and Deployment Guide](/Examples/00-setup-deployment).
