### Virtual Environment Setup
```bash setup.sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "xpander-sdk[agno]"
```

### Environment Setup
The `.env` file is created when you download your agent code:

```bash
xpander init
```

This downloads your agent code from the platform with the `.env` file pre-configured with your keys.

```python custom_tools_example.py
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from xpander_sdk import Backend, register_tool
from agno.agent import Agent

@register_tool 
def weather_check(location: str) -> str:
    """Check weather for a location"""
    return f"Weather in {location}: Sunny, 25Â°C"

backend = Backend()
agno_agent = Agent(**backend.get_args())

agno_agent.print_response(message="What's the weather in Tel Aviv?")
```

## How to Run

```bash custom_tools_example.py
python custom_tools_example.py
```

This example shows automatic tool discovery where the agent recognizes it needs weather information, calls the custom `weather_check` tool seamlessly during conversation, and uses the tool's response to provide a complete answer. Tools are registered with type hints and docstrings that help the AI understand their purpose and usage.

## Production Deployment
