<Update label="2025-11-18" description="Generalist Agent Revamp, MCP Consolidation, and Observability Improvements">

## New Features:

- **Generalist Agent Experience Revamp:** Introduced a revamped generalist assistant experience across backend and WebUI, including structured reasoning APIs, task grouping, richer task cards, and improved streaming of reasoning steps, tool calls, and outputs.
- **Agent Memories and Reasoning Timeline:** Enabled persistent agent memories with extended history and added structured reasoning timelines for each execution, making it easier to inspect inputs, tool calls, and final outputs.
- **MCP Client in Agents Service:** Consolidated MCP into the Agents service with unified HTTP/SSE transport handling, tool discovery, and invocation endpoints, simplifying how agents call external MCP tools.
- **Tool-Call Reasoning Metadata:** Added first-class support for tool-call reasoning titles and descriptions, now surfaced in both backend events and the hosted assistants UI for clearer operation intent.
- **OpenAI GPT-5.1 Model Catalog Expansion:** Expanded the OpenAI model catalog with GPT-5.1 and additional GPT-5 family variants, including updated context and output token limits.

## Improvements:

- **Hosted Assistants WebUI:** Refined the generalist task flow in the hosted UI with improved task grouping, thinking indicators, JSON output handling, iframe compatibility, cache control headers, and cleaned-up Chainlit step lifecycles.
- **Agents Workbench & Descriptions:** Expanded the agent Workbench with a dedicated description field, automatic description generation, clearer agent instructions, and safer schema-first payload guidance.
- **Environments & Deployments:** Standardized environment handling across the app, including a single default environment per organization, clearer "xpander cloud" vs self-hosted labels, and SQL helpers for listing self-hosted environments with deployments.
- **Agent Activity Logs & Metrics:** Enhanced activity logs with grouped turns, tool-call details, execution and tool durations, and per-thread input/output token breakdowns to improve monitoring and debugging.
- **Authentication & OAuth2 Flows:** Tightened WebUI and OAuth2 flows with safe redirect handling, redirect metadata propagation, more robust iframe auth recovery, and improved CLI login behavior.
- **Billing & Quotas:** Corrected usage calculations for entitlements and extras to align with dynamic plan limits, and updated subscription schema handling for billing windows and deployment gating.

## Bug Fixes:

- **Async Execution & Scheduler Stability:** Fixed async execution issues in the job scheduler and agent workers, removing conflicting event loop usage and stabilizing status polling and error reporting.
- **Tool-Call and Thread Export Reliability:** Resolved issues with tool-call event sequencing, thread export deduplication, and Agno session serialization in agent activity views.
- **Activity Threads with PII Errors:** Improved error propagation and added a PII-aware fallback that returns a minimal synthetic thread when full session data cannot be exposed.
- **Frontend UI Polishing:** Addressed multiple UI issues including chat background theming, loaders while embedded chat initializes, metrics tab rendering, agent metrics double-counting, and minor layout glitches in activity and logs views.

<Update label="2025-11-16" description="Async Platform Stabilization, Agent Improvements, and Model Catalog Expansion">
Today's update is relatively short due to the last update being 4 days ago. We're now moving to a weekly update every Sunday.

## New Features:

- **OpenAI GPT-5.1 Model Support:** Added GPT-5.1 and additional GPT-5 family variants to the model catalog, with updated context and output token limits for each model.
- **Agent Description Field:** Introduced editable agent descriptions in the Workbench and auto-generation of agent descriptions. This will be populated in the Agents list in app.xpander.ai and chat.xpander.ai (or chat.your-company.com)
- **Improved robustness of Task scheduler:** Migrated platform services to async Redis clients and offloaded non-critical work to background tasks for improved throughput and reliability.

## Improvements:

- **Environment Management:** Added option to configure default environment for agent deployments.
- **Agent Activity Logs UI:** Refined agent activity logs to group user turns, tool calls, and assistant answers for improved readability.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Improved chat background color handling, loader states for iframe chat initialization, and clarified terminology (e.g., "Executions" to "Tasks").
- **Connector and API Key Management:** Added SQL functions for environment filtering, improved API key selection in OAuth2 flows, and refined connector versioning logic.

## Bug Fixes:

- **UI Consistency:** Resolved various UI bugs, including modal race conditions, built-in tool toggling, metrics tab rendering, and chat view background color.
- **OAuth2 CLI Flow:** Improved OAuth2 CLI login flow with API key selection, authorization UI, and safe redirect handling.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-11-12" description="Platform, Agent, and UI Enhancements">

## New Features:

- **OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server:** Introduced a full OAuth 2.1 server with Remote OAuth and Dynamic Client Registration for MCP and API endpoints, including JWT-based authentication and discovery endpoints. Check out the API reference here: https://docs.xpander.ai/api-reference
- **Workbench: Built-in Tools:** Added toggles to enable/disable built-in tools like email sending and sleep toold in the Workbench Tools tab.
- **Guardrails and Agno Settings:** Expanded agent guardrails configuration, including PII detection, prompt injection detection, and OpenAI moderation categories.
- **Agent Version Naming:** Added support for naming agent versions, with editable version names displayed throughout the UI.


## Improvements:

- **Agent Activity Token Metrics:** Exposed input and output LLM token breakdowns in agent activity threads and sessions for improved monitoring and billing.
- **Connector Versioning and Upgrade Flow:** Improved connectors table with version selectors, upgrade confirmation dialogs, and better version management.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Refined metrics counting, improved modal and tab behaviors, clarified terminology (e.g., "Executions" to "Tasks"), and enhanced error handling and session management.


## Bug Fixes:

- **Tool-Call Reporting and Error Flow:** Improved reliability of tool-call lifecycle reporting, error event emission, and UI rendering for tool-call steps.
- **Thread Activity Metrics:** Corrected token metrics display and layout in thread activity views, ensuring accurate input/output token counts.
- **UI Consistency:** Resolved various UI bugs, including modal race conditions, built-in tool toggling, and metrics tab rendering.
- **Connector and Agent Settings:** Fixed issues with connector version selection, upload modal behavior, and agent settings persistence.
