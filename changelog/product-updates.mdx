<Update label="2025-11-30" description="Platform Performance, Billing, Metrics, and AWS Bedrock Integration">

## New Features:

- **Billing Synchronization and Metrics Reporting:** Introduced a billing synchronization flow that reports organization metrics to the Deployment Manager and migrates all active subscriptions to their latest plan versions. Added a dedicated `/billing_sync` endpoint and async Supabase client for improved metrics service performance.
- **AWS Bedrock Integration:** Enabled native AWS Bedrock authentication for agents, including support for AWS Bedrock tokens in deployment and runtime environments. Removed temporary provider overrides to allow Bedrock-backed agents to run as intended.
- **Helicone Integration:** Added support for Helicone API key in agent-worker secrets to enable request logging and observability.

## Improvements:

- **Performance Enhancements:** 
  - Reduced streaming latency and improved robustness of agent event pipelines by pre-starting SDK and worker streams and coordinating their outputs.
  - Optimized Kubernetes metrics collection by introducing a shared ThreadPoolExecutor and making initialization non-blocking.
  - Streamlined execution history updates and improved event-loop responsiveness.
- **Metrics and Reporting:** 
  - Standardized organization metrics reporting by switching agent counters to absolute assignment and increasing parallel processing chunk size for faster sync runs.
  - Improved organization metrics reporting for accurate billing and telemetry.
- **Configuration and Documentation:** 
  - Updated service documentation and normalized headings for clarity and consistency.
  - Aligned default user memory settings and improved configuration for agent memory behavior.

## Bug Fixes:

- **UI and Configuration Consistency:** 
  - Fixed duplicated or disabled launch configurations in VSCode settings.
  - Corrected default user memory behavior to match product decisions.
- **Robustness and Error Handling:** 
  - Improved error handling and graceful shutdown in streaming event pipelines.
  - Ensured that missing or invalid API keys do not break core agent flows, but only disable related features.
