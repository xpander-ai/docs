<Update label="2025-11-18" description="Generalist Agent Revamp, MCP Client Integration, and Activity Log Enhancements">

## New Features:

- **Generalist Agent Revamp:** Major overhaul of the generalist agent experience, including step-by-step reasoning API, task grouping in the WebUI, persistent agent memories, and improved orchestration for tool calls and sub-tasks.
- **MCP Client Integration:** The MCP client has been relocated into the Agents service, providing unified endpoints for listing and invoking MCP tools with robust HTTP/SSE transport detection, retries, and structured result parsing.
- **Session and Tool Duration Tracking:** Activity logs now display total session duration and per-tool execution times, improving observability and debugging.
- **Agent Description Field:** Agents now support editable descriptions, with auto-generation for missing values, enhancing discoverability and clarity in the UI.
- **OAuth2 CLI Login Flow:** Streamlined OAuth2 login for CLI users, with automatic API key selection and secure callback redirects.

## Improvements:

- **WebUI and Chainlit Enhancements:** 
  - Task grouping and parented tool/sub-task steps in the Chainlit UI.
  - Improved streaming, error handling, and security headers for hosted assistants.
  - Refined CSS to reduce visual clutter and improve accessibility.
  - Loader states and progress indicators for iframe chat initialization and pending tasks.
- **Agent Activity Logs:** 
  - Grouped user turns, tool calls, and assistant answers for improved readability.
  - Display of input/output LLM token metrics and per-turn durations.
  - Robust parsing of tool call payloads and headers for clearer operation tooltips.
- **Environment and Deployment Management:** 
  - Unified environment handling with clear default logic and improved sorting.
  - Enhanced SQL functions for filtering non-default environments with deployments.
- **Model Catalog Expansion:** 
  - Added GPT-5.1 and additional GPT-5 family variants to the model catalog, with updated context and output token limits.
- **Authentication and Security:** 
  - Hardened OIDC and WebUI authentication flows with safe redirect handling and improved session recovery.
  - Support for passing redirect URLs and metadata through OIDC login and callback flows.

## Bug Fixes:

- **Async Platform Stabilization:** 
  - Resolved failures in agentic task runs by aligning the scheduler and job executor with async execution models.
  - Fixed event-loop conflicts and improved error handling in scheduled jobs.
- **Agent Execution and Activity Export:** 
  - Fixed thread export in agent activity by ensuring unique message serialization and returning serializable session data.
  - Addressed missing execution records during task updates by enabling upsert-on-missing logic.
- **Billing and Quota Calculation:** 
  - Corrected billing quota usage calculations by aligning with entitlement-based usage limits and sunsetting the MCP service in workflows.
- **UI Consistency and Minor Fixes:** 
  - Addressed various UI bugs, including modal race conditions, loader states, chat background color, and metrics tab rendering.
  - Improved error propagation and PII error handling in activity threads.
  - Fixed metrics aggregation and token metrics display in activity logs.
  - Ensured robust handling of tool-call reporting, agent error flows, and tool result extraction in the UI.
