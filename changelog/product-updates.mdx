<Update label="2025-11-12" description="Weekly Product Update">

## New Features

- **xpander-mono**
  - Deprecated the Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), consolidating all MCP communication to a single HTTP-based server. This simplifies the integration and reduces resource usage. ([#3226](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3226))

- **frontend**
  - Added OAuth2 CLI login flow with callback redirect, enabling seamless OAuth2-based CLI authentication for developers. ([#1969](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1969))

## Improvements

- **xpander-mono**
  - Enhanced AI Gateway proxy by consolidating Basic Auth handling, improving secrets management, and adding request payload flexibility for development utilities. ([#3224](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3224))
  - Improved outbound connector requests to consistently handle Basic Auth formatting and securely resolve credentials via AWS Secrets Manager, with optional role assumption support. ([#3223](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3223))
  - Exposed per-thread LLM token breakdown (input/output tokens) in agent activity for improved monitoring and billing. ([#3220](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3220))
  - Increased Redis cache TTL for billing quota validation from 3 to 10 minutes to reduce repeated quota checks and external API load. ([#3214](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3214))
  - Exposed tool-call reasoning metadata (title and description) in agent runtime and UI to improve reviewability of tool invocations. ([#3216](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3216))

- **frontend**
  - Split thread activity metrics into input and output tokens and adjusted the layout for improved clarity in the Threads activity UI. ([#1981](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1981))
  - Refined agent metrics, enabled opening agent creation via URL, and standardized UX labels for improved dashboard clarity. ([#1979](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1979))
  - Added a built-in Sleep tool to agent settings and improved the chat WebUI, including support for self-hosted chat URLs and enhanced progress visibility in thread logs. ([#1976](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1976))
  - Enabled deep-linking from the Tasks list to the monitor tab and auto-scroll to the relevant thread for faster triage and debugging. ([#1971](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1971))
  - Improved OAuth2 login flow with API key selection and authorization UI for CLI authentication. ([#1972](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1972))

## Bug Fixes

- **xpander-mono**
  - Fixed agent execution state persistence to prevent missing-key errors during task updates by upserting agent executions when records are missing. ([#3222](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3222))
  - Stabilized tool-call reporting, generalist instructions, and agent error flow for improved reliability and clarity. ([#3219](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3219))
  - Addressed bugs impacting agent execution flow and Chainlit UI, tightened PII/instructions handling, and ensured consistent tool-call step rendering. ([#3218](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3218))
  - Improved task thread error handling and xpander SDK user mapping for more explicit API error semantics. ([#3210](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3210))
  - Fixed agno setting and version bump. ([#3225](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-mono/pull/3225))

- **frontend**
  - Fixed UI issues including text changes in agno settings, default masking of detected PII, and metrics tab display. ([#1983](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1983))
  - Ensured safe redirect handling for WebUI authentication, only allowing trusted destinations and correct session token forwarding. ([#1982](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1982))
  - Addressed race conditions in the "Just a minute" modal and ensured built-in tools are open by default. ([#1978](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1978))
  - Fixed chat WebUI behaviors and added support for toggling the Sleep tool in agent settings. ([#1975](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1975))
  - Fixed small UI issues including footer display, version selection, and upload modal. ([#1961](https://github.com/xpander-ai/frontend/pull/1961))
