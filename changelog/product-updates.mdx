<Update label="2025-11-18" description="Generalist Agent Revamp, MCP Consolidation, and Observability Improvements">

## New Features:

- **Generalist Agent Experience Revamp:** Introduced a revamped generalist assistant experience across backend and WebUI, including structured reasoning APIs, task grouping, richer task cards, and improved streaming of reasoning steps, tool calls, and outputs.
- **Agent Memories and Reasoning Timeline:** Enabled persistent agent memories with extended history and added structured reasoning timelines for each execution, making it easier to inspect inputs, tool calls, and final outputs.
- **MCP Client in Agents Service:** Consolidated MCP into the Agents service with unified HTTP/SSE transport handling, tool discovery, and invocation endpoints, simplifying how agents call external MCP tools.
- **Tool-Call Reasoning Metadata:** Added first-class support for tool-call reasoning titles and descriptions, now surfaced in both backend events and the hosted assistants UI for clearer operation intent.
- **OpenAI GPT-5.1 Model Catalog Expansion:** Expanded the OpenAI model catalog with GPT-5.1 and additional GPT-5 family variants, including updated context and output token limits.

## Improvements:

- **Hosted Assistants WebUI:** Refined the generalist task flow in the hosted UI with improved task grouping, thinking indicators, JSON output handling, iframe compatibility, cache control headers, and cleaned-up Chainlit step lifecycles.
- **Agents Workbench & Descriptions:** Expanded the agent Workbench with a dedicated description field, automatic description generation, clearer agent instructions, and safer schema-first payload guidance.
- **Environments & Deployments:** Standardized environment handling across the app, including a single default environment per organization, clearer "xpander cloud" vs self-hosted labels, and SQL helpers for listing self-hosted environments with deployments.
- **Agent Activity Logs & Metrics:** Enhanced activity logs with grouped turns, tool-call details, execution and tool durations, and per-thread input/output token breakdowns to improve monitoring and debugging.
- **Authentication & OAuth2 Flows:** Tightened WebUI and OAuth2 flows with safe redirect handling, redirect metadata propagation, more robust iframe auth recovery, and improved CLI login behavior.
- **Billing & Quotas:** Corrected usage calculations for entitlements and extras to align with dynamic plan limits, and updated subscription schema handling for billing windows and deployment gating.

## Bug Fixes:

- **Async Execution & Scheduler Stability:** Fixed async execution issues in the job scheduler and agent workers, removing conflicting event loop usage and stabilizing status polling and error reporting.
- **Tool-Call and Thread Export Reliability:** Resolved issues with tool-call event sequencing, thread export deduplication, and Agno session serialization in agent activity views.
- **Activity Threads with PII Errors:** Improved error propagation and added a PII-aware fallback that returns a minimal synthetic thread when full session data cannot be exposed.
- **Frontend UI Polishing:** Addressed multiple UI issues including chat background theming, loaders while embedded chat initializes, metrics tab rendering, agent metrics double-counting, and minor layout glitches in activity and logs views.
