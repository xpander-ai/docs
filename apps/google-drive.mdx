## Authentication Options

Choose the authentication method that best fits your needs:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Built-in xpander.ai Auth">
    {/* <Frame caption="Sign in with Google using xpander.ai's built-in authentication">
      ![Sign in with Google](/images/placeholders/sign-in-with-google.png)
    </Frame> */}

    The simplest way to connect Google Drive is using xpander.ai's built-in authentication:

    1. Go to the **Apps** section in xpander.ai dashboard
    2. Select **Google Drive** from available integrations
    3. Click **Sign in with Google**
    4. Select your Google account and grant permissions
    5. Your connection is immediately active and ready to use

    <Note>
    This method is recommended for most users. xpander.ai securely manages your OAuth tokens without exposing any credentials.

  <Tab title="API Access">
    {/* <Frame caption="Google Drive API access configuration">
      ![Google Drive API Access](/images/placeholders/google-drive-api.png)
    </Frame> */}

    For programmatic access and automation:

    1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    2. Create a new project or select an existing one
    3. Enable the **Google Drive API** in Library
    4. Go to **Credentials** and create an **API Key**
    5. Restrict the API key to Google Drive API only
    6. Copy the API key to xpander.ai's Google Drive connection settings
    7. Set appropriate API access restrictions in Google Cloud Console

    <Warning>
    API keys provide limited functionality and are best for read-only operations on public files. For full access, use OAuth methods.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual OAuth Configuration">
    {/* <Frame caption="Manual OAuth configuration for Google Drive">
      ![Manual OAuth Configuration](/images/placeholders/oauth-configuration.png)
    </Frame> */}

    For advanced customization and enterprise setups:

    ### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials

    1. Log into [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    2. Create a new project or select existing one
    3. Enable the **Google Drive API** in Library
    4. Configure **OAuth consent screen** with appropriate scopes:
       - `/auth/drive.file` (recommended)
       - `/auth/drive` (full access)
       - `/auth/drive.readonly` (read-only)
    5. Create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** (Client ID & Secret)
    6. Add `https://app.xpander.ai/oauth/callback` as redirect URI

    ### Step 2: Configure in xpander.ai

    1. Go to **Apps** section in xpander.ai dashboard
    2. Select **Google Drive** and choose **Manual Configuration**
    3. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
    4. Specify the required scopes
    5. Click **Authorize** and complete the OAuth flow
    6. Verify connection is active

    <Tip>
    Manual configuration gives you precise control over permissions and is recommended for enterprise deployments or specific security requirements.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Service Accounts">
    {/* <Frame caption="Google Drive authentication using service accounts">
      ![Service Account Authentication](/images/placeholders/service-account.png)
    </Frame> */}

    For organization-wide access or automated workflows without user intervention:

    ### Step 1: Create a Service Account

    1. Log into [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    2. Navigate to your project → **IAM & Admin** → **Service Accounts**
    3. Click **Create Service Account**
    4. Give it a name and description
    5. Assign appropriate roles (e.g., "Drive File Creator")
    6. Create and download a JSON key file

    ### Step 2: Configure in xpander.ai

    1. Go to **Apps** section in xpander.ai dashboard
    2. Select **Google Drive** and choose **Service Account**
    3. Upload the JSON key file
    4. Verify the connection status

    ### Step 3: Share Resources

    - Share specific Google Drive folders/files with the service account's email address
    - The email usually follows this format: `service-account-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

    <Note>
    Service accounts act as separate Google identities and are ideal for background processes, automation, and accessing shared organizational resources without user intervention.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Google Drive Integration

xpander.ai's Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the proprietary technology that powers AI agent interactions with Google Drive. Unlike basic integrations, MCP provides:

- **Secure credential handling** - OAuth tokens are managed securely without exposing keys
- **Enhanced context awareness** - AI agents maintain context across file operations
- **Document state management** - Track changes and updates across sessions
- **Structured data exchange** - Standardized format for AI-to-Drive communication
- **Intelligent operation routing** - Automatic selection of appropriate Drive API endpoints

This protocol enables your AI agents to interact with Google Drive in a more natural, secure, and efficient way than standard API integrations.

## AI Agent Google Drive Prompt Library

{/* <Frame caption="Effective prompts for Google Drive AI agents">
  ![AI Agent Google Drive Prompt Library](/images/placeholders/gdrive-prompts.png)
</Frame> */}

### Document Creation Prompts

Use these prompts to have your AI agent create Google Drive documents:

```
Create a new Google Doc titled "{title}" with the following sections:
- Executive Summary
- Project Scope
- Timeline
- Budget
- Team Responsibilities
```

```
Generate a weekly report for {project} based on the data in the "{spreadsheet}" file. Include progress metrics, blockers, and next steps.
```

```
Draft an email to the team about {topic} and save it as a Google Doc. Include key points from our last meeting on {date}.
```

### Document Analysis Prompts

These prompts help your AI agent extract insights from Google Drive documents:

```
Analyze the document "{document_name}" and extract the main points about {topic}. Provide a 3-paragraph summary.
```

```
Read through all documents in the folder "{folder_name}" and identify common themes related to {keyword}. Create a summary document.
```

```
Compare the two presentations "{doc1}" and "{doc2}" and highlight the key differences in approach and content.
```

### File Management Prompts

Enable your AI agent to organize and manage Google Drive files with these prompts:

```
Find all files related to {project_name} created in the last {time_period} and organize them into folders by document type.
```

```
Create a folder structure for project {project_name} with the following subfolders: Documentation, Assets, Planning, and Reports.
```

```
Search my Drive for files containing information about {topic} and share them with {email_address} with view-only permissions.
```

## Google Drive AI Integration Troubleshooting

### Common Authentication Issues

- Verify Client ID and Secret are entered correctly in xpander.ai
- Ensure the complete OAuth flow was successfully completed
- Check that redirect URIs match exactly between Google Cloud and xpander.ai
- Confirm Google Drive API is enabled in Google Cloud Console for your project
